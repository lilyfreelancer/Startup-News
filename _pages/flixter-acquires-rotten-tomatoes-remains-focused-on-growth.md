Flixter has acquired movie review site Rotten Tomatoes, combining the two movie-oriented services to become one of the largest resources around. Previously a property of IGN, Rotten Tomatoes is now part of a new media family. The acquisition amount has not been revealed, though IGN will retain a minority stake in Rotten Tomatoes.

According to Mashable, there were rumors of Flixter being acquired by IGN, with possibilities around combining Flixter and Rotten Tomatoes under the IGN umbrella. IGN, however, is in the midst of refocusing its efforts on the male, gaming demographic. Perhaps Rotten Tomatoe didn’t quite fit the bill given IGN’s new direction.

But either way, it appears that Fliter and Rotten Tomatoes were destined to be together. If not under IGN’s umbrella, than under Flixter’s. The user-generated search engine for movies has gained traction as a resource and a personalized recommendation service, putting it in a good position to acquire another company that could help its primary cause. To that end, Flixter and Rotten Tomatoes have worked together in the past. Both companies have provided review content through various movie review resources and applications.

The applications, on social networks and mobile devices, are a strong suite for Flixter. The company already has a number of apps for social networks across the major platforms such as Facebook and [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/). Its mobile presence is also growing, with various outlets through which it streams its content. While Rotten Tomatoes and Flixter will remain separately operating websites, the combined reach of the two review sources will span a wide range of users.

It makes sense that Flixter and Rotten Tomatoes would keep separate websites to retain their brand, image and product. The two services still have a great deal they can accomplish cooperatively without having to re-brand one service or another. Cross-promotion between the two services could also prove beneficial, as they appeal to different aspects of a single industry.

The acquisition also reflects Flixter’s desire to grow its reach. For Flixter in particular socially integrated actions and distribution is key to Flixter’s future survival. Having the ability to focus its growth on this arena while utilizing new property Rotten Tomatoes only adds to the overall usefulness of their new combined efforts.
