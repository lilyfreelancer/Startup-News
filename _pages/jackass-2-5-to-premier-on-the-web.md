We here are bub.blicio.us scour the Web to find the most exhilarating, innovative, and thought provoking stories.

MTV New Media, Paramount Pictures Digital Entertainment, and BLOCKBUSTER are unleashing JACKASS 2.5, the first-ever, studio-backed feature streamed in its entirety online.

JACKASS 2.5 will be made available for free courtesy of BLOCKBUSTER, here, beginning December 19th through December 31st, 2007.

Johnny Knoxville delivered a special message to the media on jackassworld.com, a new site and joint venture of MTV Networks and Dickhouse Productions that officially launches February 9th, 2008.

On December 26th, the unrated “JACKASS 2.5” DVD with bonus features and an extra 45 minutes of never-before-seen footage will be available for rent exclusively at participating BLOCKBUSTER stores and blockbuster.com. It will also be available for purchase at all major DVD retailers.

Beginning December 26th fans of the brilliant artistic troupe can download-to-own JACKASS 2.5 at movielink.com, iTunes, Amazon.com and other participating services. And as of Jan 1st, 2008, the movie will also be available for download-to-rent exclusively at movielink.com.

The launch of JACKASS 2.5 is the first in a torrent of new stuff to come from the JACKASS crew on all platforms. From your TV, to your computer and even your local participating BLOCKBUSTER store, no place will be safe from Johnny, Bam, Steve-O and the rest of the crew, and their mindblowing and gag-inducing antics.

So, let’s put aside that this is mostly made up of content from Jackass 2. Let’s also ignore that although this is spun as the first theatrical release to premier on the Web, it really would have been a direct-to-DVD release anyway.  
What’s unique about this announcement is that it represents how Hollywood is starting to get it. Different vehicles require different roads to reach their audiences. But, what’s common throughout, is that the Web can be much more powerful than simply spreading word of mouth, it’s a full blown content distribution and promotion medium that is already changing everything from music, to movies, and everything related to entertainment.
