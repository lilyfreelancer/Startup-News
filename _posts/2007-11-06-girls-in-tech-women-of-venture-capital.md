Porter Novelli’s stylish South Park office hosted last night’s Girls in Tech event. The organization, founded by the equally stylish LaurieAnne Lassek and Bub.blicio.us’ own Adriana Gascoigne, focused its third event on women in venture capital. The male-dominated industry was represented by Trae Vassallo (Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers), Jennifer Fonstad (Draper Fisher Jurvetson), Eve Phillips (Greylock Partners) and Maha Ibrahim (Canaan Partners). The four panelists answered questions asked by moderator Joanna Glasner, a senior editor at Thomson Financial, and some from the audience of about 70. Topics ranged from the dos and don’ts of business-plan presentations to the relatively new focus on green (or clean) tech.

Before and after the panel discussion, attendees enjoyed champagne and snacks. The panelsits graciously stuck around for a bit, answering the questions of some of the entrepreneurs in attendance.

Girls in Tech was founded in February of 2007 to further support women in an industry that, anyone who has been to a tech event will tell you, is full of guys. GIT believes women in the industry would “be better off by developing improved resources, cultivating stronger relationships and celebrating our achievements more often.”

The organization, which is able to dramatically increase the typical ratio and women to men at its events (it was about 50/50 last night — no small feat in this sector), is getting ready to launch a website that will feature a blog written by Flickr’s Maya Baratz (seen below) and high-quality video of GIT events.
