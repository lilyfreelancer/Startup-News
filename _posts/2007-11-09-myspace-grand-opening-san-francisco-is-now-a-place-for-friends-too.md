I’m trying to catch up on a few posts that I still think are worth sharing. Hey, if nothing else, the pictures are worth a look – if I do say so myself.

Basically, I started writing this post from the lobby of the W Hotel where everyone was anxiously anticipating the start of the Myspace party at SF MOMA.

But it wasn’t the normal crowd. The lobby was overflowing with beautiful young women dressed as if it were New Year’s Eve. In fact, I had to be the only guy, other than the bartenders, in the entire place. Why I didn’t get some pictures…I simply don’t know.

If I was going to have to spend a few hours with this crowd, I guess introductions were in order.

Los Angeles meets San Francisco, San Francisco meet Los Angeles.

What could only be described as a culture clash, MySpace redesigned SF MOMO into something that resembled an ultra lounge straight out of So Cal, or even Las Vegas for that matter.

SF MOMA was suddenly a place for friends, although, it wasn’t Web 2.0 or MySpace that brought the beautiful crowds. The party was thrown in conjunction with 7×7 Magazine, a local San Francisco pub dedicated to socialites and the art of fine living.

Geek celebs, movers and shakers, and other Web 2.0 influencers were also present to help celebrate the grand opening of MySpace’s new San Francisco office. If you’re a developer and looking for a new job, they’re hiring up to 200 people over the next two years.

Rupert Murdoch was also briefly in attendance, although I was preoccupied when he tried to say hello. Sorry Rupeter…next time!

My partners in crime for the night were Frank Gruber of SomewhatFrank and MyAOL, Jen Consalvo of AOL, Tom Foremski of Silicon Valley Watcher, and Hooman Khalili of 97.3, CBS, and hooman.tv. None other than “Hammer” almost made the list, simply because we spent quite a bit of time talking about his new startup DanceJam, his killer wardrobe, upcoming movies, and the beautiful “art” at the museum.

Overall the night was pretty grand to say the least. The food was very chic, the drinks were beyond premium, and the company was, well, fun. We decided to close the place down.

The most interesting and entertaining part of the night was the dance floor mashup between the geeks and the 7×7 crowd, all dancing “next” to each other but fully self-contained within their own microcosms.

The party didn’t end there however, the crowd migrated back to the W where it continued well beyond my depature.

Now that MySpace is a neighbor, I’m sure we’ll see more parties that I’m sure will rival the Yelp Elite soirées.

Some of the folks in attendance that made time for a quick chat and a drink include:
