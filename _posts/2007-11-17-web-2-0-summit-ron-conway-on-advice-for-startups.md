If you’ve got a startup in Silicon Valley, or anywhere for that matter, chances are that you’ve heard of Ron Conway. The so-called “Godfather of Silicon Valley” has made over 20 investments in Web 2.0 companies such as [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/), Digg, PBWiki, Seesmic, the list goes on and on.

Recently, Ron has been very vocal about his advice for startups in the downward economy recommending to his companies that they conserve cash and cut costs, even renegotiate all expenses, including rent.

We grabbed Ron for a quick interview at the Web 2.0 Summit last week to hear for ourselves so listen up!
