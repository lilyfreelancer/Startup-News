According to a new report by Michael Arrington at TechCrunch, Twitter is currently worth 1 beeeeellion doll hairs.

The company is rumored to be closing an additional round of funding estimated at $50 million, which will purportedly place Twitter at a $1 billion valuation as a result.

Earlier this year Twitter closed a round of $35 million in a round led by Benchmark Capital and Institutional Venture Partners, which valued the company at $250 million.
