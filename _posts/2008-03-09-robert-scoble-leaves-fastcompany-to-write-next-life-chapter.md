Last night during a small, but memorable dinner, we all wondered who would leak the news, Robert Scoble was leaving FastCompany. The story is live on TechCrunch right now and according to the story, Scoble confirmed with Mike sometime before the evening was over.

Indeed Robert Scoble is leaving his full time job at FastCompany.tv to introduce, well, we’ll let him tell you at SXSW. He’ll continue to write a column for FastCompany in the future.

Scoble continues the story in his post, “Why I haven’t posted for two weeks.”

I’ll let the pictures tell the rest of the story…
