What a whirlwind 24 hours.

I flew in. Met with several companies. Caught up with favorite press and bloggers. Ate hot wings at 3 a.m. Slept for a few hours. And, then flew back to San Francisco on Virgin America, my new BFF.

Oh for the record Valleywag, I was in the press room… 🙂

In my brief time there however, I can’t say that I was blown away by anything other than technological progress. See here for a few things that caught my eye. Although I didn’t make it over to the Sands, I heard that there were some very interesting gadgets from international companies that were worth seeing. Instead, I’ll have to read about it like everyone else.

Of course there were the bigger, brighter and thinner things you’d expect. There were also smaller, more portable things of what you would expect too. Things were faster. While others were more integrated.

Still, all the discussion was around Bill Gates and his charming and hilarious video and of course, 150-inch plasma HDTVs. I agree with Joe Wilcox over at eweek. I did love Microsoft’s stay-at-home server marketing campaign, including the mock children’s book, “Mommy, Why is there a Server in the House.”

I did have a busy evening ahead, so I decided to bypass the cab line and jump on one of the shuttles back to the strip.

The cab line had to be at least over an hour, which I don’t have the patience for…unless they were handing out mobile PC carts, then maybe I’d consider it.

First stop was a vendor meeting – actually several.

Next, was the “It Won’t Stay in Vegas Blogger Party” hosted by the Parnassus Group. That was a lot of fun with a great crowd. I’ll write about it later, but in the meantime, here are my pictures from the event.

Then I boarded a shuttle to Podtech’s Bloghaus at the Bellagio along with Robert Scoble, Buzz Bruggeman, Sarah Meyers, and Rocky Barbanica. I’ll also post about this later, here are some pictures to enjoy until then.

Afterwards, Sarah Meyers and I joined the Gawker and Gizmodo crew over at Caesar’s Palace.

Valleywag would love this. After drinks at Caesars, Sarah and I hopped on over to the Palms where we joined Julia Allison, Meghan Asha, and a group of VIPS who shall remain anonymous at club Moon (very cool place by the way, complete with a retractable roof).

Maybe it’s for the better that security wouldn’t let me bring my camera in…

That was a good time, so thank you Julia and Meghan for hosting us!
