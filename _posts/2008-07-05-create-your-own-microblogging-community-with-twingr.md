Twingr is a new platform that allows you to create your own microblogging communities. It’s pretty much a scaled down version of [twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/) that allows you to create your own groups for specific tweets. Anyone hear of tweetdeck?

I’m not too crazy about the idea just yet because to be honest I don’t see the real value in it. I don’t even know if twingr syncs up with twitter. I’m not to worried about groups or organization either, but hey that’s just me. I also don’t think that twingr allows for discovery of any kind. It appears that the only way people can join your groups is if you invite them. I joined and now I am one single user in my group, I can’t find anybody else and nobody can find me, I’m on my own little island.

I can send messages to my gmail contacts inviting them to my group but I don’t think that really matters. Most of my connections don’t exist in gmail. I’m not sure what the business model is and what happens when twitter creates a “groups” feature?

Check out the demo video and tell me what you think, would you use twingr?
