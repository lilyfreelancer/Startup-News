Everyone loves BarCamp-esque events, and for those of you developers out there that are dying to get your hands on the upcoming Microsoft Windows Mobile platform 6.5 OS, you’ll be interested in hearing about WinMoDevCamp. Whew, that’s a mouthful.

WinMoDevCamp is actually a series of upcoming events for developing applications for the open Windows mobile platform. occurring in 6 cities worldwide, the first WinMoDevCamp is slated for August 19th in Redmond, Washington. Yep, that’s on Microsoft’s campus. Subsequent locations will include Austin, London, New York, San Francisco and Singapore. Stay tuned for details on the other upcoming events.

These events are important for both Microsoft and the developer community, as Microsoft’s latest mobile platform will be key in the soon-to-open application store that Microsoft is launching. Getting apps into this store could mean a great many things for Microsoft, especially as it will need to compete on some level with [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) and Android in the mobile application retail space.

Just today Apple announced 1 billion downloads to its mobile app store alone, having been a year since its app store launched for the iPhone. And the WinMoDevCamp has even been inspired by BarCamp and iPhoneDevCamp for the intimate settings by which development of valuable applications can begin to be achieved.

Even as Microsoft will likely focus on business apps with its app store, the necessity for leveraging its existing developer base as well as the applications it already has for web, desktop and mobile use are important points of consideration for Microsoft. Encouraging and enabling the developer community is key to any platform approach. Microsoft is neither a stranger to this method or opposed to it.
