It’s official! Palm has announced that the Pre will make its debut on June 6th, just a couple of days before the big [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) WWDC keynote.

The Palm Pre will be sold in Sprint stores, Best Buy, Radio Shack, select Wal-Mart stores and online at Sprint.com with a $199.99 price tag. That price requires a a two-year service agreement and is after a $100 mail-in rebate (So I suppose you’re shelling out $300).

You have your choice of Sprint’s Everything Data plan or the Business Essentials with Messaging and Data plan. The wireless Touchstone charging station for the Pre (not required – it comes with a wired charger) will also be available on June 6. The Touchstone kit will be sold for $69.99 or you can buy the individual pieces for $49.99 (charger) and $19.99 (back cover for the Pre).

Now I just have to cross my fingers that the Pre lives up to my very high expectations. Rumor has it that they aren’t going to have a whole lot of Pres on hand, thereby creating demand after a sell-out. Well, my AT&T contract is up in August. I hope the kinks are worked out of the OS and the phone is in stock by then because I really want (need?) a Palm Pre.

Oh yeah. And I hope it works with my Mac.
