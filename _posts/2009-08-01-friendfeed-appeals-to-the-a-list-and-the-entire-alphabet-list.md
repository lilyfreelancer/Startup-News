In case you missed it, Louis Gray recently renewed the fervor over FriendFeed by publishing a list of “elite” bloggers that were using FriendFeed. Very clever 

Mr. Gray. Very clever. _golf clap_

I have to say, I really enjoy his posts. And this one, well, he knew it would regenerate the discussion and draw attention from everyone on the list (see below). Indeed he was correct on both fronts. In fact, it’s made Techmeme a couple of different times.

Duncan Riley of TechCrunch calls it, “This Year’s [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/),” but isn’t sure why, but explored it well. Michael Arrington observed that, “FriendFeed is going through a Twitter moment…It’s an inflection point.”

Riley concludes, “FriendFeed seems to be nothing more than a fancy RSS service with commenting thrown in for good measure.”

Robert Scoble gushes over FriendFeed, “I love my FriendFeed. I subscribe to a ton of people on FriendFeed and notice that often the conversations after a Twitter message will be 1000x longer (and generally more interesting) than the Twitter itself.”

Loic Le Meur simply observed that he’s getting a new friend added every minute or so.

At the same time, it’s generating an interesting debate that I’m not convinced needs to come into play here.

Mark Evans calls “A Listers” beta junkies and wonders if this is just another fad in where new tools are hyped then abandoned in favor of the next shiny new object. “As Louis has highlighted, FriendFeed is interesting enough that many bloggers have tried it out. The question is how many of them stick around, how often they use it and, more important, whether it becomes an integral part of their daily online lives.”

Others share Evan’ sentiment wondering “WHY” we need yet another tool to aggregate what many do already.

NEWSFLASH: It’s not about you per se. It’s about those who enjoy following your activity online. And yes, there are many tools that do this, but at the end of the day, why not make it easier for people to connect with you using the tools that they’re most comfortable with.

The consensus is that FriendFeed is fun and definitely makes it easier and by far, more elegant, as a way of keeping a “pulse” on your network. The one thing that I need though is the ability to link directly to a “reply” option.

For example, I can’t reply to someone in Twitter based on something I read in FriendFeed without jumping through two-clicks. I know they want the conversation to take place in FriendFeed, but as of now, there’s unequivocally greater value in a hosted conversation within my Twitter community than FriendFeed – for now anyway. As another example, if someone DIGGs something, I want a link to that DIGG page, not the user profile. What I’m saying is that I’d like to see this across the board.

Then, and only then, will FriendFeed migrate from just another channel I use to aggregate my lifestream and perhaps become my dashboard for connecting me to the grid of connections and activity.

Lifestreams are not going anywhere but the mainstream.
