Mozilla labs released a new feature today called Geode which used geo-location to tell you what’s around you. Geode is an add on which asks you how much information you wish to share when you visit a particular website.

According to Mozilla:

“You’ve arrived in a new city, a new continent, a new coffee shop. You don’t really know where you are, and are looking for a good place to eat. You pull out your laptop, fire up Firefox, and go to your favorite review site. It automatically deduces your location, and serves up some delicious suggestions a couple blocks away and plots directions there.”

If you ask me I think this is a pretty neat idea. I use several iphone applications that do something similar but I think this is a great opportunity for a web browser such. I was recently in Turkey and would have loved to have this feature up and running on my firefox browser.

As Mozilla notes, the possibility goes far beyond traditional geo-location services:

“The potential here is for more than just restaurant lookups. For example, imagine an RSS reader that knows the difference between home and work and automatically changes it’s behavior appropriately. Or a news site whose local section is, in fact, actually local. Or Web site authentication that only allows you to login from certain physical locations, like your house.”

As you can Geode has a lot of possible applications and uses that make it quite attractive to the average user.

Have any of you had a chance to try out Geode yet? What do you think of Mozilla’s new add-on?
