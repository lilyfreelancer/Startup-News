This past Monday, Microsoft’s Windows Phone team unveiled the latest addition to their phone collection designed to meet the needs of the socially connected. Called the “Kin”, this new phone comes in two different versions and is geared towards the younger generation – think high school and college students – who want to post their phones and videos directly from their phone. These “lifecasters” are typically concerned with seeing what their friends are up to and even more focused about broadcasting what they’re doing – even updating their status messages on popular social networks like Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/). In a slight twist, the Kin is one of the first phones that is supposedly going to let you share music and other data with others and also utilizes new software called Kin Studio which is pretty much like iTunes for the iPhone, in my opinion.

The Windows Phone event was held in San Francisco at Mighty and a slew of journalists and bloggers were on hand to cover the story, including folks from Mashable, ReadWriteWeb, GDGT, Technologizer, VentureBeat, SFWeekly and many more, including some local television crews. No word yet on how much the phone will cost, but it will be available on Verizon Wireless soon. And by soon, I mean next month. After the event, attendees were invited to check out the Kin and get a hands-on feel for what awaits the next generation of social saavy individuals.

Here are some photos from the event:
