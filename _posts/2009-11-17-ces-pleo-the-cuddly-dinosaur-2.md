Walking around CES, I was completely drawn to animatronic animals, or robotic pets. First there were the seals; then on my last day, I found Pleo. Of course I’d fall in love with the robot dinosaur … I’m one of the folks who owns a Nabaztag. Unlike the Paro seals, who have a purpose in rehabilitative therapy, the Pleo is simply a toy. In fact, he’s an expensive toy, retailing at $349 on the Pleo site and only a few dollars less on Amazon.

Pleo is supposed to be a one week-old Camarasaurus dinosaur. He interacts with you completely, expressing tons of emotion with his big blue eyes. His “sophisticated sensory system has devices that enable him to hear, see, sense touch and to detect objects.” Every Pleo comes with a training leaf, a companion guide, a rechargable battery and an AC charger. He weighs 8.8 pounds and is 15x4x8 inches.

I can’t believe how far robotics have come, making toys like the Pleo accessible to all of us. He’s not exactly the coolest tech in the world, but he definitely is rather bubblicious.
