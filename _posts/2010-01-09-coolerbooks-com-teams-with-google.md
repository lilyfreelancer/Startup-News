CoolerBooks.com Teams with Google  
by Michelle Lentz

CoolerBooks.com is now billing itself as the world’s largest eBookstore. It was announced today that CoolerBooks has paired with Google to include over 1 million public domain books from Google Books.

Starting today, COOLERBOOKS.com will feature a Google API with out of copyright works from the Google Books index, accessible for free via the COOLERBOOKS.com website, and the COOL-ER ereader. With this partnership, COOLERBOOKS.com becomes the largest ebookstore in the world, with over one million titles available for purchase or free access.

CoolerBooks also produces the Cooler eBook reader, which looks sort of like a giant iPod. The eBook store carries 19 different file formats, including PUB and PDF, and MP3.

This is sort of a direct hit at Amazon who, again, carries books only in the AZW format for it’s AZW-reading Kindle.
