SOBCon 2009 (a.k.a business school for bloggers) is just around the corner and this year promises to be a rocking event! The event is going to take place from May 1-3 in Chicago, all the details you need for SOBCon can be found on their homepage. Speakers for this years event include:

Brian Clark  
Chris Brogan  
Liz Strauss  
Terry Starbucker  
Christine Kane  
Anita Bruzzese  
Lorelle VanFossen  
Chris Garrett  
Wendy Piersall  
Dave Bullock  
To get more info about all of these speakers check out their brief bios. So how do you get the discount? Simple.

SOBCon is running something called “Blog It, Earn It.” In order to earn the 25% discount all you have to do is write about what the “ROI of Relationships” means to you. Talk about why relationships matter, how they affect your daily life and how you manage and create relationships. Basically SOBCon wants to know how relationships and personal connections help shape the world you live in. Personally relationships and personal connections ARE the world I live in, without them I would be struggling.

Once you blog your thoughts about relationships link to this original post by Terry Starbucker and send out your post on [twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/) using the hastag #blogitearnit. You will also receive a link back from the SOBCon blog. Once you do this you will receive a special code for $200 off. So just recap:

blog about relationships  
link back to the original post  
send it out on twitter with the correct hashtag  
receive special discount code.  
All blog entries must be posted no later than March 7, and the discounts must be redeemed by March 14.

Simple enough right?

So get to blogging!
