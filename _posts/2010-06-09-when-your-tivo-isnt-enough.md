[Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) today announced that iTunes will now carry High-Def shows from the four major TV networks: NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox. Apple also made sure to announce that since it started offering HD downloads last month, there have been more than one million episodes downloaded.

“We’ve got an incredible Fall 2008 TV lineup with over 70 primetime comedies and dramas, including many of the most popular shows on TV in stunning HD,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s vice president of Internet Services. “With over 200 million episodes sold, iTunes customers have proven they love watching television on their computer, iPod, iPhone and TV with Apple TV.”

You name a show and it’s probably there. The HD lineup includes“Brothers & Sisters,” “Desperate Housewives,” “Dirty Sexy Money,” “Eli Stone,” “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Life on Mars,” “Lost,” “Ugly Betty,” all three CSIs, “NCIS,” “Numb3rs,” “Bones,” “House,” “Prison Break,” “30 Rock,” “Heroes,” “Law & Order: SVU,” “Life,” “Lipstick Jungle,” “My Own Worst Enemy” and “The Office.” Basic cable shows owned by the networks are also available and include shows from Sci-Fi, USA, and FX. Standard definition television shows on the iTunes Store are $1.99 per episode, while HD programs from ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX are $2.99 per episode, with a “bulk” season pass pricing option.

I often feel that traditional media is a bit behind, so I’m pleased to see that the traditional networks are acknowledging that we might watch their shows if our time-shifting options are expanded.
