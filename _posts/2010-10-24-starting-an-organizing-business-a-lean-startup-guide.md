<p class="bodytext">
  Today, people are busier than ever and have trouble finding the time to do everything there is to do in a day. Starting an organizing business will let you provide a relief to people who lose minutes or even hours from their days trying to put the pieces together.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  Scattered around the home are bills, clothes, books, tools, toys and magazines where clutter has attacked the homes of many.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  What you do is help people rid themselves of the clutter in their homes and offices.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  Being a professional organizer will put you in the face of clutter, and you'll be clearing everything from closets to paperwork to file cabinets and computer system files.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  When people are organized, it saves time and relieves stress in their lives â€“ giving them the time they want to enjoy their lives a little more or concentrate on their business.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  Do you know how many time-starved families there are in the world? Help them get organized and put a little more time into their lives.
</p>

## Build a Niche {.bodytextbold}

<p class="bodytext">
  <strong>To build a niche for your organizing business, you can figure out what your best organizing skills are and specialize in one specific area.</strong>
</p>

<li class="bodytext">
  You can specialize in organizing just kitchens or you can be an expert closet organizer, cleaning them out and installing systems.
</li>

<li class="bodytext">
  Maybe you like to organize home offices and help people work more efficiently by setting up a systematic approach to their workday.
</li>

  * <span class="bodytext">If you know how to tackle the computer and make it more manageable and user friendly to those who never know where they just put their last document.</span>

<p class="bodytext">
  Some organizers work with homesowners or the consumer market while other professional organizers use the business-to-business model.
</p>

## Valuable skills/Requirements {.bodytextbold}

<p class="bodytext">
  You obviously should be organized and understand the standard and proven strategies for organizing your home and of course, your clients.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  You can learn most of the skills -- as long as you can teach them to others effectively.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  This is a big word of mouth business. You'll want to get out in public, maybe even do some public speaking or workshops to help spread the word.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  Networking is also important, and this included having a business card you can hand-out.
</p>

## Marketing Your Organizing Business

<p class="bodytext">
  There are three marketing 'weapons' you should make yourself very familiar with to <span class="bodytextbold">promote your organizing business</span>...
</p>

**Submit to stratup diectories.** [like the one we have here.](http://new.blicio.us/promote-your-startup/)

<p class="bodytext">
  <span class="bodytextbold">Direct Mail</span> - Find your target audience, buy some lists and get some sales letters out the door.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  <span class="bodytextbold">Start a small business website</span> - If you have a business in this century and think you can do it without the internet, you're very, very wrong.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
  <span class="bodytextbold">Promotional Products</span> - Those little imprinted goodies you see on desks or the cups with logos you have in the kitchen is what's called promotional product advertising. It's cost effective and it works -- especially to help you build your brand over time.
