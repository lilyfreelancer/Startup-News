Google has added a standalone contact manager for users who either don’t use Gmail or for those who want to access their contacts without dealing with their mail. For Outlook users who want to also manage their contacts in the cloud, this is a great option.

You can access this feature from <http://www.google.com/contacts>. There aren’t any new impressive features, but you can still import contacts from common email applications. (You need to use the free A to G app for [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) Mail.) If you have a GMail account, your GMail contacts appear here. If you are a Google apps user, the Contacts Manager needs to be enabled by your administrator from the “Add more services” link at the Control Panel.
