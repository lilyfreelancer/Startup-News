Finally, a Salesforce CRM & WordPress Integration

I have to say it was a bit of a shocker to see Tim O’Reilly, the Godfather of Web 2.0, plug our new WordPress-to-Lead plugin during his keynote speech “The State of the Operating System” at San Francisco’s Web 2.0 Expo last week. I guess this means we are doing something right over here at salesforce.com.

Capture Web Leads Directly into Salesforce CRM with WordPress-to-Lead

We know that WordPress users have wanting a way to capture leads directly into salesforce.com, instead of losing them in their email inbox, as most WP contact form plugins tend to do. And we know that WordPress users would really like a custom contact form solution that doesn’t involve cutting and pasting code. So we’ve done it – we’ve created the WordPress-to-Lead for Salesforce CRM plugin – and easy to use contact form builder that captures leads directly into Salesforce CRM.

Most contact form plugins for WordPress send web inquiries to your inbox, which is a hassle if you get a lot of valuable business leads through your website. If you inbox is anything like mine, that message gets buried in 2 days. Ditto with any email conversation with an important prospect. With WordPress-to-Lead, you can now manage all your prospects, customers, and conversations in one place – your favorite CRM.

Building Contact Forms in WordPress has Never Been Easier

The best thing about WordPress-to-Lead (aside from its integration with Salesforce CRM) is that it is, hands down, the easiest contact form builder for WordPress. And I’m not just saying that because I work at salesforce.com – I’ve installed and attempted to configure at least 4 WordPress contact form plugins, and some of them are pretty hard to get working.

All you need to do is check which form fields you want in the WordPress-to-Lead plugin control panel, and publish the form to any page or post using the shortcode [salesforce]. That’s it. You can also publish a contact form to every page by enabling the WordPress-to-Lead sidebar widget. Don’t believe it’s that easy? Check out the video demo to see for yourself.

Why We Built WordPress-to-Lead for Salesforce CRM

This is a huge step up from implementing our traditional Web-to-Lead forms through cutting & pasting code to your webpage, especially since WordPress has that wonderful habit of stripping out the html tags you need for the Web-to-Lead form to work. Not to mention, Web-to-Lead still needs a lot of developer TLC for it to match the look & feel of your website.

WordPress-to-Lead is great for business owners who would rather spend time focusing on their business then configuring WordPress, or getting their contact forms plugins to work.

What’s even better than all that? WordPress-to-Lead is free. So turn your WordPress site into a lead generation machine today.

Installing the WordPress-to-Lead Plugin

If you’re already a salesforce.com customer, here’s what you need to do:

Download the WordPress-to-Lead Plugin  
Using an FTP client, upload the `plugin` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/`  
directory  
Login to WordPress and activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in your WordPress admin dashboard  
Update your WordPress-to-Lead settings by entering your salesforce.com organization ID. To find your Organization ID:  
Login to salesforce.com  
Go to Setup > Company Profile > Company Information

Copy the 15 digit number

Paste it into the salesforce.com organization ID field in your WordPress-to-Lead settings:

Creating Your WordPress-to-Lead Contact Forms  
Once you’ve installed and activated the WordPress-to-Lead plugin, configuring your contact form and getting it published to your WordPress site is easy.

All you need to do is configure the form settings in your WordPress-to-Lead plugin configuration page:

To publish the contact form to a post or page, simply use the shortcode [salesforce] and hit save.

Your contact form will instantly appear on the page!

If you want a contact form on every page, just enable the WordPress-to-Lead sidebar widget.

And your form will appear on every page, in the sidebar.

And voila! Creating WordPress contact forms has never been easier.

Much thanks to Metamorphosis Gourmet, a San Francisco gourmet catering company for letting us demo this plugin.
