Cisco announced today that it has officially spent $590 million to purchase Pure Digital Technologies, the makers of the Flip and Flip Ultra video cameras. Pure Digital is joining Cisco’s consumer business group, which also includes the Linksys home routers from a previous acquisition.

If you haven’t come across one yet, a Flip video camera is a handheld video camera that, using it’s handy USB plug in, uploads directly to your computer (and then YouTube), no software required. The Flip is also incredibly affordable, priced between $129 and $189, depending on where you pick one up. (During the holidays, we purchased one for $99.)
