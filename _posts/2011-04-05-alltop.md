ntroducing Guy Kawasaki’s latest startup, [Alltop](https://alltop.com/).

Like POPURLs, Alltop aggregates stories from “all the top” sites on the Web. They’ve grouped these collection into individual Alltop sites based on topics such as celebrity gossip, fashion, gaming, sports, politics, automobiles, and tech. At each Alltop site, the latest five stories are displayed from thirty or more sites on a single page, sort of like a custom-built RSS-feed page built on Netvibes.  
Basically, Alltop site is a “dashboard” or “table of contents” for your favorite topics.

According to the site, “The bottom line is that we are trying to enhance your online reading by both displaying stories from the sites that you’re already visiting and unveiling stories from sites that you didn’t know existed.”
