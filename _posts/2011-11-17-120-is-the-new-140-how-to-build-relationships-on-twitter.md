As we have mentioned on other occasions, [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/) has become a great means of communication and a platform for interaction between people. It is currently one of the main ways in which companies, individuals and public organizations spread their opinions and messages, spreading them at great speed through the network.

In this way, it is clear that the microblogging network has also become the place for Public Relations professionals, allowing them to connect with professionals from other sectors. When used tactfully and well, it allows relationships to be established to learn about specific interests and preferences with the media.

  * Twitter, when used correctly, can be a powerful Public Relations tool. But as with any communication, there are good ways and bad ways to approach it. Here are some points to keep in mind:

  * Compared to other methods, journalists tend to be more receptive on Twitter, as it forces the PR professional to be brief. In fact, it only allows 140 characters.

  * Using a direct message for the first interaction with a journalist can be a bit rude or strange.

  * If you take the time to find out what the journalist is writing about, it will be much easier for them to launch a story that is relevant to them and their audience.

  * Journalists write because people want to listen. If the PR professional can express interest in and show appreciation for the stories the journalist writes and respond to their tweets, the relationship will become closer. Journalists will listen to you if the PR professional does too.

Above all, the key to interacting with a journalist is respect. The PR professional should communicate with them in a professional manner and spend time on it. Pushing and shoving is a sure way to lose the respect of a writer, anchor, or anyone else in the news business. Instead, your needs, interests, and preferred method of contact should be considered.

By following journalists on Twitter, you can see how other communication professionals successfully use the microblogging network. By realizing what works and what doesn't for each journalist, you will be better prepared for your own approach. Following large PR firms can also be beneficial. Through conversation and observation, Twitter can be a powerful PR tool.
