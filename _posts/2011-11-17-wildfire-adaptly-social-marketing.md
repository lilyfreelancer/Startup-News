The world of social media marketing has just gotten a bit better thanks to a recent announcement by Wildfire about their partnership with social advertising company Adaptly. The global leader in social media marketing is going to get even better thanks to its integration with Adaptly’s social advertising and optimization technology. Now, while Wildfire user, which allows you to design, publish, and manage your own brand content through social media will, for the first time, give marketers full control of both owned and paid social media–combining the best of both worlds in an attempt to “maximize consumer engagement”.

In case you don’t know about Wildfire, this two-time winner of the Facebook Fund and a runner-up at the TechCrunch Crunchies in 2010 is a tech company based here in Silicon Valley dedicated to helping brands discover the marketing power of all social networks, particularly Facebook and [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/). What they offer right now is the ability for anyone (and I mean anyone) easily create their own attractive, branded social media marketing campaigns, like sweepstakes, contests, coupons, giveaways, quizzes, virtual gift campaigns, and anything else they desire. Those campaigns are then published on Facebook, websites, and even on Twitter. As you can see, it’s a lot of organic tactics that Wildfire can offer brands. But what they seem to lack is the ability to get the customer’s name and promotion out there into the wild…well until now. Adaptly’s partnership with Wildfire helps give them a well-rounded handle on the marketing industry and substantially increases their offering in an area where companies don’t want to have multiple services to manage their social media marketing. It’s a “one service to rule them all” kind of thinking.

But before we can talk about this marriage of offerings, we must understand a bit more about Adaptly. Since its founding in 2010, this New York City-based company has been working to help change the way brands gain engagement on social networks. How? By helping to “harness the unique value of each social network”. One consolidated platform is all that is needed to complete a social advertising buy across multiple networks including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, StumbleUpon and more!
