I don’t know about you, but I lost Tuesday to the election. All day I twittered about it and watched either CNN or MSNBC. And [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/) survived.

In fact, Twitter survived election day without a single Fail Whale sighting. Pretty amazing, eh? They’ve actually published the election day stats on their blog.

  * There was a usage increase of 46% from one week earlier
  * Between 7-9 pm PST, updates were up 200% compared to the same time one week earlier.
  * New users on Tuesday were up 40.3% and between 7-9 PST, they were up 96.5% compared to the previous week.
  * Messages per second peaked almost 3x in comparison to the first debate (which was also heavily tweeted).  
    And now that the election is over, we have the first President to have a Twitter account. Wonder if he/his interns/aides will continue tweeting or if the account will fall silent.

Of course, Twitter also got a shoutout from Stephen Colbert and John Stewart, which was just hilarious.

Considering that no one saw a Fail Whale, my faith in Twitter is restored. Glad to see they’re using all that venture capital money for repairs instead of band-aids.
