Facebook just got banned twice in one day.

Facebook (and previously MySpace) was banned from [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) Store computers. Apparently, Facebook is a timesuck, as Apple wants people to test-drive their computers, not write notes about 25 Random Things. By banning Facebook, more time will free up for more people to try a Mac. One genius said, “Apple Stores have become a regular Internet Cafe, so placing the most popular time-killer [Facebook] of them all on the banned-list will certainly help everyone get a chance to test out the computers.”

The Maryland General Assembly has also banned Facebook and MySpace use in their offices. According to a memo obtained by blog The New Line, a glut of viruses has resulted from Facebook and MySpace use. I can’t exactly say I buy this. I once worked in a secure government facility where even Dilbert.com was banned. Why? Because it was a timesuck.
