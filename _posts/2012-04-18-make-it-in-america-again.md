You’ve probably hear it said “the small entrepreneur is backbone of business in America.”

President Obama said we cannot overlook the importance of having a national manufacturing strategy.

Make it in America. Buy American made. But why is this important?

## Scenario for buying foreign-made products:

You purchase items made in, for example, China. Your dollars get sent back to China where their factory workers get paid and they spend your money on local purchases (or they come and buy your building and raise your rent.) The money circulates out of your community to someplace else and you never see that money again.

## Scenario for buying American-made products:

You purchase items made in, for example, Madison, WI. Your sales dollars get paid out to the factory workers in Madison where they spend your money on local purchases, possibly buying something from you. The money circulates within your community and that money comes back to you.

Robert F. Kennedy, paraphrasing George Bernard Shaw “there are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why. I dream of things that never were and ask why not.”

We cannot win our future by buying products made from foreign-owned companies.

We CAN win the future but we MUST make it and buy it in America.
