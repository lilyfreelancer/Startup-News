excerpt: |
  The Hewlett Packard organization was started by William Hewlett and David Packard who were companions as youthful electrical designing understudies at Stanford University in California USA. Having cooperated on different little extends for as far back as 3 or 4 years, the Hewlett Packard (HP) business was framed officially in 1939. The first site of the HP base camp was the extravagant surroundings of Dave Packard's carport. There were some underlying talks about the name of the business and Packard and Hewlett chose to flip a coin to check whether the organization would be designated "Hewlett Packard" or "Packard Hewlett". Packard won the flip of the coin by chose at any rate that the organization would be classified "Hewlett Packard".
