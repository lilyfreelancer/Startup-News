I’m not even sure how I stumbled onto PicJuice, but I’m glad I did. PicJuice is perhaps the world’s easiest image editor – and it’s free.

PicJuice is a web-based tool that allows you to resize, crop, auto-adjust color and contrast, rotate, and flip your images. Simply upload an image file using the quick Upload button. Then you can edit your image file using the various one-button editing tools. The image previews the changes. When a change has been accepted, a Change Applied message displays.

When you’re done editing, you can save the image as a new JPG or PNG file.

PicJuice is joining a growing area of online editing tools, including Picnik, SplashUp, and Photoshop Express. PicJuice was obviously designed with true simplicity in mind, and it’s nice to use the entire application on the Web, without a download piece. If you just need a quick and basic image editor, PicJuice might be for you. The price is certainly right.
