Shel Israel’s Twitterville as the Twitterati convened to celebrate the release of his new book, [Twitterville](https://web.archive.org/web/20120710104942/http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/twitterville.html).

I took a break from writing my next book and promoting my current book to congratulate Shel personally and also say hello to the peers, friends, and mentors who have and continue to serve as my inspiration.

Tatyana Kanzaveli organized an incredible event at the Hiller Aviation Museum in Redwood City and she deserves recognition for bringing a fantastic set of people together in an exceptional setting.
