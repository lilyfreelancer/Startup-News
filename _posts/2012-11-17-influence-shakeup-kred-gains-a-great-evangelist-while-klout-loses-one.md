It’s an interesting morning here in Silicon Valley as we wake up to discover some updates in the startup world. Sure, people coming and going are nothing new or surprising, but within the influence metric space, there’s a lot of discussion going on about whether it’s good or bad or even relevant for companies to figure out and use. At the forefront of these conversations are the evangelists — these are the people who will go out into the world and praise the name of these startups and help show you the light as to why you want to use them. Today, there are two influence metric giants out in the world: Klout and Kred. And while they are both great, they each have different news to share.

## Porter Gale

One of the best marketers in Silicon Valley has just joined up with Kred as their Chief Evangelist. Porter Gale, probably best known recently for being the Chief Marketing Officer of tech-friendly Virgin America airlines, will be the startup’s lead advisor on their new Kred Stars and Kred Leaders program. Basically, she’s going to be their evangelist who will help educate and help marketing executives while also developing advocacy programs with the community. It’s a very smart hire and something that I think plays well to Mrs. Gale’s strengths.

When asked about her thoughts about Kred, Mrs. Gale responded:

> Kred is an essential marketing metric for brands that want to build and tend to close, trusting relationships with their audience. Kred’s community-based approach creates unprecedented opportunities to identify influencers and reach the small close networks of people that share their interests.

Kred is an off-shoot product created by PeopleBrowsr, a social analytics startup with offices here in San Francisco. Kred measures influence in online communities within specific interests. A competitor to Klout, rather than ranking influence based on scores from 1-100, they offer it from 1-1,000 and claim to be the only influence measurement based on 1,000 days of social data.

Congratulations Porter!
