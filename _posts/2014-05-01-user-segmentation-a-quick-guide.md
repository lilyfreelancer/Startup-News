We understand as market segmentation in digital marketing the treatment by which a market is divided into different segments that are derived in the same way or have similar needs.

Because each segment is too similar in its needs and attitudes, it is possible that they respond to a marketing strategy in a similar way. That is, you may have the same feelings or ideas about marketing a product or service, sold at a certain price, distributed differently, and promoted equally.

However, there are several types of market segmentation depending on some business criteria, according to your demographic or geographic information, according to psychography and depending on behavioral data such as spending and consumption habits. 

In this way, once you have collected this information from the client, you will be able to get a more complete idea of what they will look like and what their expectations will be compared to what they expect to get from interacting with what they are looking for.

## User Segmentation

We can find many different ways to segment a market. Whereas, in the present relationships in the company, we can divide the market into different types of companies or countries. As for business-to-consumer commerce, we could divide it into demographic segments, lifestyles, behavior, among others.

However, these segmentations are usually used for much more complex strategies, while consumer segmentation is done with a more concentrated and practical perspective.

In relation to the above, you can segment your customers in a blog according to interaction, sources, average visits, page views, conversions, etc. On the other hand, the segmentation of an online business can range from the search for products outside that site, the abandonment at some stage in the purchase process, or the incorporation of different promotions, among others.
