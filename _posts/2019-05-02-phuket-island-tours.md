As a traveler, I’m obsessed with exploring the world, meeting new people and getting as lost as possible with my camera. And one of my dream destinations is Phuket, Thailand. Phuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is in the Andaman Sea in southern Thailand. The island is mostly mountainous with a mountain range in the west of the island from the north to the south.

Phuket offers great view, happy memories and good conversation as the Thai people are all accommodating and very friendly people.  You can do Phuket island tours with the help of some trusted Phuket travel agent or tour company in Phuket.

Number one on my list is the [James Bond Island](https://www.phuketdreamcompany.asia/). The small needle-shaped island is officially called Tapu, but it's known as James Bond Island because it appeared in 1974's The Man with the Golden Gun. Even Agent 007 fell in love with the place! Next is the tour to Phi Phi Island. Phi Phi Islands are some of the most beautiful islands of Thailand, six exotic islands of fine white sand and turquoise waters. They became famous for their natural beauty when Maya Bay, one of its most beautiful bays, starred in the movie The Beach. Last one is the Koh Khai Island. Kho Khai are famous tiny islands just 15 minutes speedboat ride from Phuket east coast. There are 3 islands: Koh Khai Nai, Khai Nai Island and Koh Khai Nok, but their names get a little confusing, especially once you know that ‘Koh’ means ‘Island’ in Thai.

Phuket is such a great place, for great adventure. Don’t let your dreams be dreams. In the end, you won’t remember the time you spend in the office or mowing the lawn. Climb that mountain. Explore that island. Let’s go!
