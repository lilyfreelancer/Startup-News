We're launching our Indiegogo for Rags! Rags is a ZERO WASTE subscription clothing box to get handpicked, vintage outfits delivered to your door! Think a thrift store- but in a box (But completely customized for you)!

Rags will be supporting those in-need in our community through financial aid, employment and career development & by partnering with grassroots initiatives to make a larger impact that large-scale nonprofits are willing to do. We are thankful for our freedom & for our ability to help others. Now it's time for you to do your part- BECOME A VIP consumer today! DON'T DONATE, JOIN US!
