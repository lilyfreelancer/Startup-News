We all need a job to make money for living, but going to an office and doing a lot of paperwork is not what you want to do, so you’re thinking of starting your own business to have more freedom.

But having a business is not as easy as it might seem, it requires a lot of work and dedication, and if you’re thinking of quitting your job to pursue your dream and turn it into something profitable then there are some aspects that you should consider first.

## Work from home

Many people want to work from home in their own business so they can have their working schedule, to gain more money, and to do something that will make them happy. 

This is very interesting, but it’s much more than just working at your desk from home since you need a lot of organization to start running a business.

If you don’t like your current job, you have to consider some aspects you need to start your own business before quitting, so you can have everything ready and don’t waste any time.

## How to be your own boss?

Your business not only needs money to continue running but also needs you to have great qualifications to make it successful.

Being your boss isn’t easy; this is why you need to work on your skills to achieve what you want. Three factors are fundamentals for becoming your boss:

  * Emotions: you need to have the emotional stability to be your boss because otherwise you’ll be subjected to your emotions and that’s not going to be good for your business. You have to learn how to handle stress and pressure, as well as working in your problem-solving skills.
  * Support: even though you’re planning to run your own business that doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re going to be alone. It’s better if you look for advice from people who has experience running a business and get support from your family and friends.
  * Management: one of the things you have to work out is your managerial skills. You need to have discipline, stick to deadlines, work hard, and appreciate all the resources that you have and use them wisely.

## What do you need?

If you’re serious about quitting your job to start your business, you have to be prepared by following the indications to become your boss without any risk. Don’t make this decision without considering first everything you need and be prepared for all the challenges that business represents.

## The capital to start

Before starting your business, you have to analyze your financial situation to determine your monthly cash flow, because otherwise, you’ll go bankrupt in no time.

First, evaluate what’s going to be your source of income. If you’re going to provide a service, you have to establish how much money you’re going to receive, and also how much money you need to spend to maintain your business.

You also have to calculate how much money you need to run your business, consider if you need to buy supplies or goods, as well as your expenses.

All of this calculation will help you understand your financial capability and this way you can estimate how much money will be necessary to start and run your business.

## Solid business plan

Once you know the purpose of your business and how much money you need, you have to start creating a working plan where you can put all the information related to your customers and all the goals you want to achieve.

Elaborate a short-term plan for your business, but don’t settle just with this because you’ll also have to elaborate a long-term plan so your business can have a future.

Write down your potential customers, the employees you’ll need, the sector you want to be, the marketing strategy, and everything related to your business plan.

## Working time

Perhaps you’re planning to quit your job and start your business immediately, but this is not how things work.  
Your business has to start first as a part-time job for you, so you can start contacting customers and work on your marketing strategy, so when you quit you’re ready to turn it into a full-time job.

You can work during weekdays in your regular job, and work part-time in your business until you consider it’s the right time to run it full-time.

This is because it’s not easy to get customers and you’ll need a lot of effort and time to achieve a financial status that will sustain you.

## Prepare your office

Once you have a considerable amount of customers and you see that your business is doing well, you can quit your current job and start looking for an office where you can work and you can have your legal company, so your customers can go there and you can start doing some networking.

In this phase you’ll have to register your business, so you don’t have any legal issues in the future. It’s better to do that now because when you’re starting to get busier you won’t have time to do it.

If you don’t have enough money to rent an office, you can run your business from your home, but you have to know that eventually, you’ll have to make that important step, since this way your customers will see that you have a serious business.

## Manage your schedule

Now that your business is running, you have to keep working and don’t be discourage if you don’t get what you expected since every startup has its good and bad moments.

To have a successful business you have to manage everything with proper prioritization since this is the best way to be productive.

Your business depends on you, so you have to manage your schedule in a way that you can do the most important things first, so there are no pending issues.

Continue searching for clients so you can grow exponentially and you can make the incomes that you need to live.
