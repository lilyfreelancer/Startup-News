If you’re working as a hairdresser but you wish to have more time and you’re tired of working for someone else that is taking a big portion of your work, then you should consider starting your own business by using all the knowledge and experience that you have.

Perhaps you haven’t considered doing this because you think it takes a lot of effort, but having a mobile hairdressing business might be the best for you if you follow the simple rules to have a great start.

# Becoming a mobile hairdresser

A hairdresser typically works in a salon, but a mobile hairdresser goes to their clients’ location to provide the service that they require.

This is great for you since you can charge the amount that you consider is appropriate and all the earning will remain with you, without the need to share a percentage with the salon owner. You’ll also have more control of your time, and you can work whenever it’s best for you, establishing your working schedule.

It’s also good for the client since he/she will get the hair done right at home without having to go to a salon and wait for a long time.

As you can see there are a lot of benefits to becoming a mobile hairdresser, so it’s time that you consider everything you need to start right away.

You can offer your services as a hairdresser for normal routines such as cutting and styling, or you can specialize in hairstyles so you can work for clients who are going to a special event such as weddings, proms, graduations, and so on.

# What do you need for your business?

Before starting your mobile hairdressing business you need to do some planning and organize everything so you can look professional and provide the best service for your clients.

Bear in mind that if you’re going to offer a service you have to be good at what you do, so this way your clients will recommend you.

# Tools and equipment

The first thing you need to work as a mobile hairdresser is the equipment that will allow you to get great results. So you have to consider investing in some quality tools that will work without any troubles.

If you’ve been working as a hairdresser you know that there are a variety of brands that you can choose, but you have to select only the best ones so you can give your clients a result that looks like made in a professional salon.

This means that you have to buy high-quality scissors, combs, hairdryers, straighteners, and curling irons, as well as great shampoos, conditioners, dyes, and any other product that you think you’ll need.

If you have enough money you have to invest in professional equipment and tools because even if you can use your clients’ things, it’s better if you have your owns since this will make you look like your taking your job seriously.

As for the products and chemicals that you’ll need, it’s advisable to look for a trustable supplier that can offer you excellent prices so you don’t have to spend a lot of money with them. You can also ask your clients to buy the products by themselves if they want to, you just have to talk about this with them and they’ll choose the best option.

You’ll also need to have something to carry all your equipment with you, so you can buy a suitcase, a bag, or any other that feels comfortable for you, but remember that it has to look very professional, so don’t buy anything that it’s poor quality.

# Clients

Working as a mobile hairdresser means that you need to have clients that request your services, and this can be a little hard at first, but once you have found your initial clients, if you do a good job they will recommend you, and your business will start growing.

If you’re just starting you can ask your family and friends to recommend you, and this is great because it’ll help you get your first few clients.

Don’t be discouraged if you can’t find a lot of clients during your first weeks since it’ll probably take some time. You have to continue offering your services and eventually, you’ll start to receive requests.

# Price list

One thing you should have prepared before looking for clients is your price list, this way you can give the proper response and any inquiry quickly. 

If you have all your prices tabulated, you can send it to your clients and they will know all the services that you offer and how much you charge for each one of them.

This is going to make you look professional since you’ll be able to give a fast answer to your clients, and this is something that everyone likes. Besides, this will save you a lot of troubles that usually comes when business owners don’t know how to calculate their prices.

# Marketing strategy

When you’re starting you can ask your closest people to recommend you and help you get clients, but eventually, this won’t work since you’ll get a top number of clients, and you want to get as many clients as possible.

This is why you have to consider designing and applying a marketing strategy so you can reach a bigger audience and your potential clients can know about you.

You can start in your local area since it’s going to be easier for you to move to your new clients’ location if they’re closer to you, and it’ll also be more practical for them.

### There are two main strategies you can apply:

  * Having a website: if you have a website, people can find you in the search results of local hairdressers, and you can offer your services from here, as well as offer interesting content that can make you reach the top of Google results.

  * Social media marketing: you can offer your services by your accounts, and you can post photos so everyone can see the great work that you do.

You have to choose the best strategy for you that allows you to reach more people, and that better suits your business.
