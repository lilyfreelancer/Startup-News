There are many types of speeches involved with gatherings for business, and its delivery is important for any company. The purpose typically is to present information to an interested audience, but they still need to be full of engagement and connection with those listening.

Whether it’s [after dinner speakers](https://www.therightaddress.co.uk/after-dinner-speakers/) or simply office presentations, writing and rehearsal go into effective speeches, and performance is critical for client retention.

## Information Delivery

Information speeches are purely to deliver information in front of the audience. While bells & whistles can be a part of such presentations, it comes secondary over concise data that the target audience can digest.

For example, [environment and sustainability speakers](https://www.therightaddress.co.uk/environmental-speakers/) will want to present global warming data without bias, and present possible solutions within their speech.

Such speeches may also include informative processes, such as instructions on how to use software or displaying how a product works. This may also include resources for employee training or how to use a newly launched product by the company.

## Persuasive Speeches

Persuasive speeches are designed to sway an audience towards a viewpoint that perhaps would make someone more included to do business with them. It could be in the format of a debate, with different speakers giving their point of view to sway the judges or audience. It could also simply be a representative of the company giving a convincing proposal to businessmen.

While these types of speeches can be more fact-based than others, the point is typical to show the value of a company or product. This can also go into swaying an audience for political or broad philosophical topics,

## Special Occasions

Your business may have special events in which superiors of the company will give speeches to employees, investors, and possibly members of the press. It can range from giving motivation, providing updates about the company, or introducing a newly anticipated product.

For example, in an introduction speech, the speaker will introduce themselves and/or their company to an audience that may not be familiar with them. This could happen when a new manager takes hold and he wants to make a good impression upon his new subordinates and may include a mission statement.

## Commencement Speeches

This type of speech is important for boosting morale by recognizing the achievements of individuals, teams, or perhaps a whole office of employees. This can include other aspects outside of the company, like educational achievements, charitable contributions, and other things noteworthy.

## Hiring Speech Writers or Speakers

Speeches are not always recommended to go off the tip of your tongue, especially if you’re dealing with some technical subject matter. This is why it’s beneficial to hire speechwriters that can do research, appeal to an audience, and improve the delivery of your company’s message.

Similarly, professional speakers can be hired for events if you or members of your team are not so great with public speaking. The investment will add entertainment, professionalism and overall more value to your public events.
