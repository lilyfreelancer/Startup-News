Are you an anime fan? If yes, you’re not alone. Although it’s impossible to give an exact estimate, there are millions of otakus all over the world. And yet, the hunger for quality **anime blog** content is insatiable.

Now may be a great time to turn your passion into your dream job. That’s because the anime industry ranks among the world’s most lucrative ones. Its market value is currently estimated at nearly 20 billion dollars.

At the same time, there aren’t many good anime blogs on the web. There are a few reasons for that. For starters, some bloggers lose interest after a while and stop posting new content. Then, there are those fans that have no idea how to create and run an anime blog.

Luckily, I’m here to ensure that your anime blogging venture will be a successful one. This article will show you how to start an anime blog in **four easy steps**. Here’s what they are:

  * Buy a domain and find a hosting provider
  * Set up your website
  * Create engaging content and be consistent
  * Advertise your anime blog

# A Step-By-Step Guide to Creating an Anime Blog

Starting an anime blog is as easy as ABC. The tips I am about to give you will help you create and run one all by yourself. You won’t even need programming skills to put them into practice.

## 1. Buy a Domain and Find a Hosting Provider

_Choose Your Domain Name and Extension_

First, you need to choose a domain name and extension for your anime blog. These are the two main components of a website’s address.

For example, let’s say you have animeblog.com as your address. Here, “animeblog” is the domain name, and “.com” is its extension.

But don’t just settle for the first thing that comes to mind. Pick a domain name that is:

  * Short
  * Catchy and attractive
  * Related to the topic of your blog
  * Easy to remember

Many bloggers prefer to go with “.com” when it comes to domain extensions. It tends to be [more secure and reliable](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/are-you-hurting-your-website-by-not-using-a-com-domain). That’s why there are so many websites that end in .com.

Once you choose a domain name and extension, you need to register them. Typically, that will cost you $5–$15 per year. You can register them with a domain registrar or your hosting provider.

That brings me to my next point.

_Find a Hosting Provider_

The second thing you need to do is to choose a hosting provider. That’s a company that allows clients to use its servers to host their websites. For that reason, it is essential to pick a reliable hosting service.

For example, a great option you should consider is [offshore hosting](https://uncensoredhosting.com/best-offshore-hosting/). It offers many benefits, such as fast load times and high security.

Furthermore, offshore hosting services use servers that are based outside your country. That means they comply with different legislation. As a result, your offshore hosting provider will give you more freedom of speech — a vital detail for every blogger.

## 2. Set up Your Website

One of the fastest ways to create an anime blog is using a Content Management System (CMS). WordPress.org is the easiest CMS platform to use. So, you should consider relying on it to build your website.

**WordPress** offers a wide selection of **ready-made themes**. They feature all pages of the site. Also, you can easily customize everything about them.

Still, don’t pick a theme randomly. The [best anime WordPress themes](https://prospected.com/best-anime-wordpress-themes/) are always flexible and functional.

Another option you have is to use **HTML templates**. Similar to themes, they’re versatile and adaptable. However, they may be trickier to customize.

Luckily, you can buy pre-made website templates online. Some of the [best anime website templates](https://prospected.com/best-anime-templates/) are visually appealing and translation-ready.

## 3. Create Engaging Content and Be Consistent

Hopefully, you have already come up with a **topic for your anime blog**. Go for something that you are passionate about. At the same time, opt for a topic that many other anime fans will find interesting. Otherwise, you will never attract a lot of regular visitors.

Also, one of the [best lessons learned from anime blogging](https://www.japanpowered.com/finds-and-ramblings/lessons-learned-from-7-years-of-anime-blogging) is to focus on one main subject. Instead of posting random anime content, be consistent. Don’t jump from topic to topic. **Choose your lane** and stick to it.  
For instance, you can cover one of the following topics:

  * Cosplay
  * Anime news
  * Top 10 lists
  * Anime events
  * Product reviews

Try to make your anime blog unique by creating content that is one-of-a-kind. That will help you stand out.

## 4. Advertise Your Anime Blog

Creating high-quality content is not enough. You also need to promote it. That will help you attract more people to your website.

You can advertise your anime blog in more than one way. For instance, you can use the power of **social media** to share your content. Anime fans are very active on [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/) and Facebook, so you can start from there.

**Email marketing** is a tried-and-true way to promote a website. However, you first need to gain enough followers or subscribers. That will help you collect a lengthy list of emails.

You probably know that anime lovers have a soft spot for forums. Use that fact to your advantage. Join different anime-focused forum websites. There, you can quickly spread the word about your creation.

Another effective way to advertise your anime blog is to **write guest posts**. They can be published on popular [anime guest blogging sites](https://wowitloveithaveit.com/blogs/blogs-that-accept-guest-posts/ultimate-list-of-anime-blogs-and-websites-for-publishing-guest-posts) and can link back to your website. This marketing strategy can swiftly put you on anime fans’ radar.

# Conclusion

As you can see, creating an anime blog is quite easy. You don’t need to have coding skills to make it happen. All you need is a passion for anime.

Combine that passion with the steps listed in this guide. The result will be a fully functioning blog that you managed to make all by yourself!
