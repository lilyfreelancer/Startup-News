Until now, it seemed that the only area of electric locomotion to be conquered was the sea.

Proposals such as the construction of an oil tanker powered by electric energy by Japan are an example of the effort made by some countries to opt for the use of this system of locomotion for the propulsion of ships.

It is under this premise that the American company Triton, with headquarters in Barcelona, made the presentation of DeepView24, an electric submarine built with a capacity of 24 passengers (not including the pilot and co-pilot) who on board this vehicle will have the opportunity to make underwater tours with a depth limit of 100 meters.

In this sense, the DeepView24 presents in its structure a hull formed by a transparent cylindrical cabin and large windows of 14 centimeters thick.

All of this is supported by an air conditioning and pressurization system, which provides protection to the passengers, so that they can feel calm when appreciating the marine landscape of the depths from their seats with total comfort.

Regarding its propulsion system, it is formed by 2 main engines, supported by 4 auxiliaries responsible for the direction, which are fed by a battery equipped with capacity to allow the submarine to make dives of up to 14 hours.

In addition to the construction of this electric submarine, the American company Triton has been responsible for the manufacture and marketing of the mini-submarines with a capacity for 1 or 2 people used in scientific and recreational diving of lesser range.

Another of the submarines on this company's list is the spectacular DSV Limiting Factor, considered to be a deep-water lift. This, due to the capacity it has to perform immersions several times a week at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, managing to stay there for a long time when it is a long visit.

## The first in the DeepView series

It should be noted that the DeepView24 is the first in the series of DeepView submarines that the company Triton plans to build in different sizes, with capacities to carry between 6 and 66 passengers.

The intelligent design present in the DeepView24 has been applied with modularity in mind, so that its structure allows the incorporation of 6-seat sections. The 24-seat version has a length of 15.4 metres and a weight of 55 tonnes, although these measurements can reach an increase of almost 3 times their value in the 66-passenger variant.

In the case of the electric submarine's propulsion and steering, these are controlled by the action of two 20 kW (27 hp) main engines and four 12.6 kW (17 hp) Vertran thrusters, which are powered by a 240 kWh lead-acid battery.
