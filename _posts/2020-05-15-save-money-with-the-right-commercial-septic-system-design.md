Moving your business to a new location?

The first thing you need to take a look at is the septic system. The septic on your property could be out-of-date and end up costing your time and funds to repair.

A new, modern septic system design can save you tons of money – not to mention protecting your local environment. Here’s what you need to know:

## 1. Ditch the leach field

Traditional septic systems, both residential and commercial, rely on a leach field that percolates wastewater into the soil. While this system generally works, it can often lead to harmful groundwater pollution. That’s the last thing you need around your business!

[Modern commercial septic systems](https://nexgenseptics.com/services/commercial-septic-system/) let you ditch the leach field by filtering 99% of harmful bacteria inside the septic tank. That way, you save space, protect the environment, and never have to worry about backups and clogs.

## 2. Never deal with repairs

The other major downside to old-school septic systems is the maintenance. Since they depend on gravity and time to filter wastewater, they can easily get backed up, flooded, or cause a leak. Those repairs will really add up, wasting your business’s time and money.

But in a modern, [eco-friendly septic system](https://nexgenseptics.com/products/advanced-enviroseptic-septic-systems/), the breakdown of waste is accelerated using air or natural bacteria. That means less maintenance and repairs, and long-lasting security!
