With the current pandemic, concerns of global warming, and mass unemployment, I think the whole world is starting to reconsider our priorities. While it’s hard to sway the powers that be, those looking to start or invest in small startups should also consider the value it has on the planet.

Here is a list of what I think the market will need in the near future, both for the good of humanity, and for filling lucrative roles in the new economy that will emerge:

## Electric Vehicles

Tesla is leading the headlines for electric cars, but it still is out of the price range for the common person, and even less so in developing countries. Just taking a look at converted [vintage electric cars](https://www.ioniccars.com/), there are limitless possibilities to make electric cars mainstream.

Electric cars are more than just sporty, but it’s also about cost efficiency and lessening your carbon emissions. Take a look at how this startup took a classic [electric Porsche 964](https://www.ioniccars.com/works/porsche-964-targa/) and reduced the refueling charge to £8.21, down from £95.13.

There is more need in the market than just producing or converting cars. We need innovative startups to solve the problem of making charging stations more available and possibly better ways to manage energy stores. This is why most people living outside of large cities still are dependent on gas-fueled vehicles.

## Solar Energy

With the rising cost of energy in many parts of the world, few people are averse to the idea of getting off the grid. What remains the primary barrier to entry is usually the cost and inconvenience of installing equipment to make a home 100% sustainable.

Being pragmatic with limited knowledge and resources, there is still room to move into the space of installation services, solar product distribution, or simply product repair & maintenance. These less-technical jobs will certainly grow as more houses adopt solar energy.

As far as producing solar cells, most of it is done overseas (like China or Germany), and this includes research & development. There is also demand for simply assembling panels and kits by buying from the producer, creating a brand for yourself. If there is a lack of panels in your local area, there is definitely a wide profit margin to be had.

## Remote Employment

Let’s face it, most offices are quite useless, and even more so since employees are afraid to go into work. The economy must go on, and aside from essential services, most non-physical labor can be done from home anyway.

While freelance platforms, software, and accounting had already existed, it needs to scale so that the majority of the world can participate. The market needs competition from the likes of Fiverr or Zoom, which have a host of unresolved problems that the developers don’t have much pressure to fix.

## Local Ecommerce & Logistics

Another aspect concerning the “new normal” that the world is moving towards is making online shopping for all aspects of life widely available. It isn’t sustainable to make long, generously spaced lines outside supermarkets. Even small businesses need to be available for purchases & delivery to maintain social distancing.

Keeping things small, you could offer services developing and maintaining an e-commerce store for your local pharmacy, corner store, or bakery. The idea is to take small businesses and bring them online as a means to mitigate the further dominance of Amazon, Walmart, and other big brands.

Small niche businesses still need to maintain a presence on platforms like Google Maps, Uber Eats, and social media, which create their own host of business opportunities.
