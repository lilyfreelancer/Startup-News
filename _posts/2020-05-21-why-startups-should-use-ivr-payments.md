The 2020 [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/) pandemic is fundamentally changing the way many businesses are operating, particularly the payments related aspects of businesses. With many employees being restricted to working from home, businesses are facing a unique set of challenges. 

For example, a live service agent must be prepared to handle customer’s sensitive information. But how can cardholder data be kept safe in a home environment?

Utilizing [IVR Payments](https://www.agilepayments.com/ivr-payments) can allow businesses to securely handle interactions with their customers. IVR payments allow for automated secure Payment by phone, facilitating customer interactions via their mobile phones, and allowing customers to make payments at their own convenience, 24/7/365 by calling into an automated system to make payments via voice prompts. 

IVR Payments are a great tool for any business, but are a particularly prudent solution for certain industries such as:

  * Cable and Telephone 
  * Health Care
  * Alarm and Security 
  * Waste Management 
  * Utilities
  * Property Management 
  * Non-Profits
  * Self Storage 
  * Tax Payments

IVR systems can handle huge loads of calls in lieu of a large staff of live service operators, reducing workload and improving cash flow. Time previously spent answering phone calls and entering transactions manually can be reallocated, meaning improved efficiency in your business!

IVR systems facilitate both Inbound and outbound communication. Inbound communication is the most common type of communication via IVR. This occurs when a customer is calling into a company or organization in search of information, trying to make a payment, etc. Outbound communication occurs when your business reaches out to customers (typically in the case of missed payments).

Social distancing doesn’t have to impede customer relations, as messages regarding your business’s operations can be automated (via email, SMS, or voice messages). An IVR system allows messages to be customized/organized and sent to customers in mass. By the same token, customers can manage their own accounts remotely and securely, whether it be changing details, making payments, etc. Processing IVR payments adheres to PCI (Payment Card Industry) standards.

Amidst a global pandemic it’s likely that payment collection will be an issue for business at some point. An IVR system can automate some of these aspects by, for instance, sending customers an email/SMS message containing a secure link for online payment. Likewise, your business is able to reach out to customers efficiently rather than reach out to customers individually - a time consuming and often fruitless task.

Ultimately, the most important thing for any business during these uncertain times is to maintain a positive relationship with their customers. Depending on the type of business, it’s likely that many of your customers will reach out with similar questions. An IVR system is ideal in such a situation, as it allows your business to automate responses to such inquiries.
