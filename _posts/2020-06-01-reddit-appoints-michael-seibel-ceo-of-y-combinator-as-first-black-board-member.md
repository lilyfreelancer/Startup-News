Reddit listened to the recommendation of its co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, when he resigned from the company's board of directors and urged that he be replaced by a black candidate.

On Wednesday, Reddit named Michael Seibel, CEO of the accelerator Y Combinator, as the first black board member in the company's history.

    Pleased to see @mwseibel has joined the @Reddit board. I've had the pleasure of working with him during my time at @ycombinator.
    
    He is a strong leader who will make a great addition to the board.
    
    - Alexis Ohanian Mr. &#x1f680; (@alexisohanian) June 10, 2020

In 2014, Seibel became the first full time black partner of Y Combinator. During his time at YC, he has invested in companies such as Cruise, Brex, Figma, Triplebyte, Reddit, Paystack, Mattermost, Rezi, Rippling, PayFazz, AptDeco, Squire, Magic, Scentbird and more.

Seibel co-founded Justin.tv, which later became [Twitch](https://new.blicio.us/how-twitch-got-started-what-happened-to-justin-tv/), in 2007 and also co-founded and served as CEO of Socialcam, a popular social video application and another successful Y Combinator startup. In 2012, Autodesk bought Socialcam and in 2014, Amazon bought Twitch for $970 million.

Last week, through a series of tweets Ohanian, who is married to tennis player Serena Williams, said his family was one of the reasons he decided to quit. 

Ohanian tweeted: "I say this as a father who needs to be able to answer his black daughter when she asks me, 'What did you do?

This is after the outbreak of anti-racist protests in different cities of the United States for the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police on May 25. 

Reddit, which calls itself the first website, has long fought to address racist content on its platform.

Earlier last week, some of Reddit's most popular threads were taken down in an effort to protest hate speech and racism on the platform, according to Business Insider.
