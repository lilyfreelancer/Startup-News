A team of Australian scientists from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and Monash University developed the prototype of an augmented reality eyewear that promises to be able to identify, detect and read a person's emotional state through artificial intelligence.

This communicative system of neorological response is called Neo-Noumena, and according to its manufacturers, there is a fairly promising potential for use in people with autism. This is all we need to know about them.  
Neo-Noumena, everything about this gadget with augmented reality included

As far as their operation is concerned, the Neo-Noumena analyze the signals sent by the brain and then they are collected and transferred to a program that uses artificial intelligence, where these same signals are studied and interpreted before being sent to the glasses. In theory everything sounds more than interesting, because if we have positive results, we will be able to know all the emotions of that person in front of you.

Florian 'Floyd' Mueller, creator of the Neo-Noumena and director of the Stress Game Lab at Monash University, explained that: "by using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, mobile electroencephalography (EEG) and mixed reality, we can evaluate the neurogenic emotion in real time and display this digital content in a physical space".

The prototype of these glasses has been tested on 5 different couples so far, where they indicate that there was an improvement in each of the people, as they could better understand how their respective partner felt after associating certain factors such as stress, for example.

The Neo-Noumena have been only a prototype so far, a project that wants to be the pioneer in this complex area. And of course, although they still need some time until they have a sufficient trajectory to draw complete conclusions, this teaches us that every day we advance a little more in different branches of science and that in a not so distant future everything can change.
