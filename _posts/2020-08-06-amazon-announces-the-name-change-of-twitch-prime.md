Amazon was planning to change its name to [Twitch](https://new.blicio.us/how-twitch-got-started-what-happened-to-justin-tv/) Prime to replace it with Prime Gaming, well, the powerful online store has already made this move by making the name change and making this Prime Gaming known.

The official website of the service is already available in Spain and the rest of the world and it gives an overview of the different advantages that Prime Gaming subscribers have, such as fast and free shipping of Amazon products or free games and loot.

Amazon itself points out that we are in front of a new name but with "the same great advantages". On the website itself, they literally point out that "Prime Gaming continues to include a free subscription to a Twitch channel, lots of free swag from your favorite games, over 5 free PC games every month and much more with your Amazon Prime subscription.

At the moment it seems that we are facing a change of name or brand so that the Twitch Prime service is even more linked to Amazon although, as we indicated before, a priori with this change of brand we will find higher quality free games and the content creators will have different advantages.

We will have to keep track of the service during the next months to know which direction Amazon wants to take with Prime Gaming.
