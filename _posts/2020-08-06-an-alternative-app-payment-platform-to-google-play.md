If you like to pay for every purchase you make through the Internet and your cell phone, there is a payment platform that is growing like a lather and that allows all companies to have their customers use the payment method that is most convenient for them: through an app, through the official website or the company's own physical store.

This alternative is called [Adyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adyen) and aims to compete with the two main virtual stores in the world: we are talking about the Google Play Store and the [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) App Store. Next you will know the simple use of this tool that, although it has been available for years, this year has had a greater increase in customers and transactions.

This Dutch company founded in 2006, hopes to achieve the goal of being the necessary help for those small and medium sized companies, without being a direct substitute for the Play Store or the App Store, or at least for the time being. Even so, the firm based in Amsterdam works as a payment platform for important services worldwide, such as Uber, Netflix, Rappi, Spotify and some others, achieving revenues of 279 million euros in the first quarter of the present 2020, 27% more than in the same period of 2019.

Going further into its capabilities, we commented that Adyen allows the use of credit cards and even uses PayPal to make payments, achieving with this more than 3,500 regular customers today. The company's CFO, Ingo Uytdehaage, noted that due to the pandemic, they have seen growth in online sales, mainly over their clients working with food products and digital services.

As commented by the guys on the platform: "Those related mainly to the sale of perishables such as Justo, who is our client, iFood in Brazil, Rappi throughout Latin America are helping these types of companies and we hope to add to more in the future. We have seen a lot of interest in digital goods such as gaming, which has been in high demand in pandemic, for example.

## Adyen payment options

It allows payments in more than 150 currencies and they expect to start operations in more regions soon. To register, you can do it through this official link.

The growth of this company is clear, and although today they are not positioned at the same level as Apple and Google stores, we know that they can scale faster than other tools. As we know, both Google and Apple charge a 30% commission for transactions in their digital stores, so the other platforms can offer a lower commission rate to generate more customers.
