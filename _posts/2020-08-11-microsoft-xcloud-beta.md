As we already knew a little less than a month ago, Project xCloud will become part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription at no extra cost for users, which is officially scheduled to start on September 15th.

Now, [according to The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362384/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-beta-date), those interested in Project xCloud will have a preview starting today in the form of limited beta access. They will have to upgrade to the new version of the Xbox Game Pass beta application for Android and, obviously, be Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, which will allow them to try out a limited number of titles, as they will not have the full catalogue planned for official launch.

According to The Verge, the beta access will have about 30 titles available from the more than 100 games it expects to have for launch. Microsoft's idea is to enable a smooth transition to the game streaming experience within the Xbox Game Pass application on Android.

However, the future of Project xCloud on [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) devices is still uncertain, so Microsoft is reducing the testing of xCloud on iOS in this uncertain scenario.

On the other hand, within the planned roadmap, the company plans to close the beta phase a few days before the official launch of its game transmission platform, in order to have everything ready by September 15th.

Microsoft is the last company that has yet to launch its cloud-based games transmission platform, an offer that will be added to the existing ones from Google and Nvidia, whose idea is to take advantage of the cloud's capacities so that users do not have to have powerful hardware to play at full capacity with games that may demand a high level of power.
