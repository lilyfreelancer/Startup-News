The fortunes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg have suffered from the launch of Instagram Reels, the tool intended to unseat TikTok in social networks. Zuckerberg's net worth has exceeded $100 billion for the first time, an increase of $22.1 billion so far this year.

[This was indicated by the Bloomberg Billionaire Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-06/zuckerberg-s-fortune-surpasses-100-billion-with-facebook-surge), which stated that the global launch of Reels has had a very positive effect on Facebook. In this way, Zuckerberg has become what has been called a "centimillionaire", a status in which other technological giants such as Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, and Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, were already present.

Zuckerberg's fortune is largely due to his 13 percent share of Facebook.

According to Bloomberg, the founders of America's largest technology companies have enjoyed an incredible accumulation of wealth this year, as the coronavirus pandemic has prompted more people to go online. 

Zuckerberg had already said that his plan is to give away 99 percent of his Facebook shares over his lifetime.

Now, it is Jeff Bezos who leads the ranking of the richest, with a fortune of 190 billion dollars, experiencing an increase of 75.3 billion dollars so far this year thanks to the good results of Amazon in these months. 

On his part, Bill Gates has a fortune of $120 billion, some $6.2 billion more than at the beginning of the year.

Next are Frenchman Bernard Arnault, of the luxury empire LVMH, with a fortune of 81.4 billion dollars, and Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani, owner of the energy company Reliance, with a fortune of 80.3 billion. 

There is also room in Bloomberg's ranking for Spain's Amancio Ortega, but he is in 16th place, with a wealth of $56.9 billion. However, Inditex's shares have fallen due to the coronavirus, so it has lost $15.6 billion this year.
