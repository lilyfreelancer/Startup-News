The [Facebook team](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/paid-online-events/) announced a new option on the platform: paid online events.

An option that will be available to businesses, media publishers and educators, among other user groups. With a simple setup, Page Managers will be able to organize paid events.

An initiative that can be customized for almost any online activity... talks, classes on different topics, consulting, events with experts, etc. Facebook wants this new option to be a tool for companies that had to adapt their services and customer service.

And as for the fees, Facebook assured that it will not charge any kind of commission to companies and creators for a period of time. So they will be able to keep all the income they generate with the events.

> For transactions on the web, and on Android in countries where we have launched Facebook Pay, small businesses will keep 100% of the revenue they generate from paid online events.

These paid online events are spreading to 20 countries, as can be seen in the Facebook Business Helpdesk. There you can also see the requirements and conditions for using this feature.

Along with this announcement, Facebook also mentioned the issue of [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/)'s commissions. As you may have noticed, only Android and the web are mentioned as the ways to make paid online events without paying commission. This is the reason:

> We asked Apple to either reduce their 30% App Store tax or allow us to offer Facebook Pay so that we could absorb all the costs of the companies struggling during [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/). Unfortunately, our applications were rejected and SMEs will only receive 70% of their income.
