In today's internet-driven world, people determine the credibility of a business by looking into its website. Most computer management systems (CMS’) will offer a range of themes and layouts for [web designers](https://marketingsweet.com.au/web-designer-adelaide/) to choose from, which creates a clean structure to work with. However, how you actually utilize this space is really what’s going to make or break consumer engagement, which is why graphic design is such an important component. So, to provide you with a bit more guidance, we’ve created a list of different ways that you can utilize graphic design to really captivate your audience!

## How to Use Graphic Design for Your Website Performance?

A professional and user-friendly website isn’t just about the visual component, it also depends on the value of the content, and the clarity of the communication. But communication isn’t limited to text, you can effectively communicate with your audience using graphic design as well. Some examples of this are infographics, where you reflect certain facts or more complex information in a visual diagram.

It’ll make it easier for the viewer to actually interpret the data, helps break up or segregate different aspects of the business, and actually enables you to fit more information in. And of course, if your [web designer](https://marketingsweet.com.au/web-design-sydney/) gets a bit creative it can really add some aesthetic value to your website as well.

### Layout and Colour Scheme

With hundreds of templates available online, it has become pretty easy to pick a layout for your website—but the work doesn’t end there. Simply downloading a [template](https://wordpress.com/themes), uploading it and swapping out the content won’t make the cut if you’re wanting to leave an impression on your audience.

So, here are a few pointers on how to make it a bit more personalized to align with your branding, which will help with memorability and create a consistent flow throughout your website.

The more obvious point to consider is colour palette. Try not to use anything to harsh on the eye, like mixing two primary colours for example, and make sure to utilize the same tones throughout.

Another graphic element that will help distinguish your branding is the typography, including the size, font and general style of the text—particularly when it comes to headings. We do recommend keeping the smaller text quite simple for viewers to read, but feel free to get a bit creative with your headings to make them personalized.

### Versatile Logo

The logo is the first thing a customer will typically notice about your company, and it’s important to apply it across all marketing material to help with brand memorability, once again.

We have a few pieces of advice when it comes to creating a visually effective logo. Firstly, you want something versatile that will suit the formatting of all your physical and digital marketing material. Whether it’s big, small, printed or published online, it has to be that balance between clear and decipherable, plus creative.

We recommend incorporating some form of symbol into your logo, which can be applied to things like work shirts, business cards, or even used as a watermark on your website to tie everything together. Really good graphic designers will often present a few different concepts, because it’s not the type of feature you want to be changing down the track!

### Call to Actions

Call to Actions are an essential feature for any website. Their purpose is to instill a sense of urgency, communicating to your audience that you have the solution to their problem or interest. Within call to actions, you usually include a button to the contact page, a phone number, or a link that directs people through to the product or service you’re really trying to push.

The overall goal with the homepage is to give people enough confidence in your business, that the Call to Action is the final push they need to make their investment. However, there’s also plenty of opportunity to get creative with your Call to Actions so they blend seamlessly with the rest of your design.

### Interactive Elements

Interactive elements are key to engagement. People like clicking, scrolling and having moving elements on the page to make it more visually interesting. However, this can definitely be over-done, and you also need to be considerate of mobile optimization, so you need to be clever about the way you do it. Some examples of interactive elements you can incorporate with graphic design include:

  * Using parallax in the background of Call to Actions etc.
  * Using effects like sliding, floating or appearing as you scroll down the page
  * Incorporating auto play videos in sliders and banners

## Conclusion

We hope our advice will help you make some more creative choices with the graphic design work on your website! We do definitely recommend taking advantage of the pre-designed themes and layouts available, but don’t settle for stock-standard—make your website memorable by incorporating our suggested techniques. But keep in mind that sometimes, less is more!
