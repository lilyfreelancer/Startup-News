**Submitted by Jessica Silver from ElWell**

When my friend rang me in summer 2018 with a burning idea, I thought why  
not. I'd grown disillusioned with my job working in PR, the idea sounded  
exciting and, most importantly, I was positive that working with a life long  
friend was the right decision. Now, almost two years later, what have I learnt?  
And was I right to trust my instinct and make the leap? Here are my top tips  
for working with a friend.

## Finding that friend you can work with

You get on well with your friend, maybe you even work together currently at a  
business which you don’t own. But how do you know if the friend you land on  
a business concept with is someone you should go into venture with?

I’m lucky enough to [work with my oldest friend](https://www.el-well.com/about-us/) (we met in the playground  
aged six!). We’ve always brought different but compatible skills to the table  
throughout our friendship and this has been one reason I knew we could work  
together. One of us is analytical, the other more creative. These two sides  
allow us to communicate effectively and look at ideas through different  
perspectives. We love and respect each other, and in business this isn’t  
something to flippantly disregard. We both also come from entrepreneurial  
backgrounds and knew this was something we wanted to explore. Doing it  
together makes it even more special.

It’s a truth that the best work happens when people gel well – when you look  
at it like that, going into business with a real friend is something to be  
celebrated.

## Turning a friend into a work friend

There's evidence to suggest that having friends at work improves productivity  
and your job satisfaction. But when a friendship pre-dates the business, what  
does that mean for productivity?

We quickly learnt that we needed to treat our business relationship like any  
other. When we’re at work together (even if our office is the kitchen table at  
one of our houses), we’re in work mode. Different roles were naturally  
assigned to us and from there we stepped up to the mark. Together we set  
targets, managed information flow to each other, listened and ultimately held  
ourselves and each other accountable. Yet at the same time, we can switch  
off and still see each other for the friends we are. So we don’t think our  
friendship has suffered at all (if anything, it has got stronger) and we have  
also become more productive work-wise too.

## What if you see the business going in different ways?

It’s understandable that new ideas develop and the business evolves.  
We’ve looked at new opportunities together, and our litmus test for them is  
whether or not they match up with our strategy. Then, we work out how we  
can make this happen whilst maintaining other projects and sharing the load

accordingly. By being strategic and not tactically focused on the detail, we’re  
able to identify what’s best for the business and worth our investment (be that  
financial, time or both).

## Ask for feedback

For some reason, asking for feedback from a friend can be more nerve  
wracking than from your old boss. Maybe it’s because you know each other  
so well and so you get more worried what you they think? Whatever the  
reason, feedback from your nearest and dearest is always important in life,  
and especially when you work together.

The number one rule when taking feedback from a friend that you work is not  
to take it personally. It’s like the business is the third friend in the relationship,  
and we need to honour it as we would ourselves. So treat any viewpoint  
positively. I’ve always found it actually to be a confidence boost, showing that  
I’m on the right track. And remember that two heads are better than one – so  
any constructive feedback (which is what feedback should be!) helps you  
strive towards the end goal.

## Tackling difficult conversations

When I was working in an agency, difficult conversations weren’t tinged with  
friendship – the work came first. But what we’ve found now is that being  
friends first and foremost can actually make them easier. We want to be  
solutions-focused, not just for the business but for us too.

No one likes a difficult conversation but side-stepping them is even worse.  
When we need to discuss something where we might have slightly different  
views, we hold a specific meeting where this is the focus. Setting a meeting  
objective (even if this is just to come to a final decision) and having the time to  
discuss and consider each other’s views is important so we can do what is  
right for the business. This helps us to see the wood for the trees, make a  
decision and move on – still friends like before!

## Making it official

We created a business together because we have the same ideology and  
wanted to work together. But we also knew we needed to be smart and put a  
contract in place. So that’s what we did. We’re equal shareholders, with equal  
responsibility. It’s not something to easily walk away from (not that we want  
to!) and having a contract in place makes it that bit more official. No matter  
how good friends you are, this is something we would always recommend.  
Would I recommend going into business with a friend?

Life’s too short not to work how you want, with the people you want to work  
with! If the opportunity presents itself, then go for it.

Don’t think that working with a friend means you’re in for an easy ride though.  
Consider if you’re being tempted by the idea of the friendship rather than the  
business. Do you both have similar work ethic and values? And is this  
something you can commit to for the near future (and more)? If the answer is  
yes, then go for it! Good luck – you’re in for a great ride.
