Since there are no two without three, or so the saying goes, the Californian software company Oracle has now joined the list of companies interested in acquiring a share of the successful social network TikTok, the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/272cfc69-b268-45ac-88d6-d55821f27e78) reports today.

According to the publication, Oracle has already held talks with ByteDance, the parent company behind TikTok, to acquire the company's businesses in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, also in line with Microsoft's aspirations.

But there is one drawback, and that is that ByteDance, if it were to give up, would only sell the operations it has in the United States. In any case, Oracle is already working with venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, to try to acquire a part of TikTok.

For now, it is not known how TikTok could fit into Oracle, although Microsoft and [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/) have pointed out, according to different analysts, that it goes much further than having a social network of reference, especially for a niche of younger users, which will also be an interesting source of advertising revenue, as well as allowing knowledge of the consumer trend among young people, or for the advanced Artificial Intelligence technology available.

At the moment nothing seems clear, everything will be seen over the course of these weeks, and in fact it remains to be seen if, in the case of buying the American operations, TikTok would be divided into different platforms, or users in the United States can see the content of users from other parts of the world and vice versa.

We will have to keep an eye on everything that comes up about TikTok, as the situation looks interesting and worthy of future analysis, which will surely come up with a situation never seen before in the social media landscape.
