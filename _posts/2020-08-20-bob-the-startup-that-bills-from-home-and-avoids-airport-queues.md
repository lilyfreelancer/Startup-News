Following the opening of borders, the flow of flights and travel has increased. Therefore, avoiding luggage in the cabin to reduce contact with staff and time at the airport is one of the recommendations of the European Aviation Safety Agency to [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/).

In view of all this, travellers are led to rethink their travel experience to make it safer, more comfortable and more secure. Bob helps check in from home to avoid airport queues and minimize risks. And, without leaving home.
