No one is free from computer attacks, although companies must take greater security measures to protect all their information from the possibility of data leakage or theft.

Companies of all sizes are the main victims of computer attacks, including the largest companies that may have better resources to try to prevent them.

In this regard, the National Institute of Cybersecurity (INCIBE) has just launched an interesting game to raise awareness among those responsible for these attacks about the existing channels of attack and the measures they should take to avoid them.

[Hackend, as the game is called](https://hackend.incibe.es/), aims to offer basic notions about security in companies to those responsible for them who lack a minimum level of knowledge.

To do this, the game offers nine levels that must be overcome, in each of which they will have an introductory video, and in which basically, they have to look for where the information has escaped from their companies.

The game is available both as a mobile application, for the Android and iOS platforms, and as a web application, the latter being the most recommended option.

Although it is necessary to wait for the game to load, with some patience, those responsible can take a certain level of awareness to protect their companies, whatever the level, and more so when more and more companies are aiming at digitalization, and more so in times of pandemic.

And while it has a clear focus for businesses, this does not prevent anyone else from also acquiring a set of basic knowledge that they can also apply in their day-to-day lives on a personal level.
