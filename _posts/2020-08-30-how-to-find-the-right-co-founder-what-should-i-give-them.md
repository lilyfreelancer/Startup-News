  * Ask yourself some questions. "What kind of organization do you want, vertical or horizontal? How open are you? How willing are you to come out? Do have compatible skills?
  * Distribution. "Evaluate the issue of trust, capital and amount of work.
  * The details. If your partner puts in $10,000 but is not going to be there, find someone else.
  * ## If it doesn't work, let it go.

Not everything is honey on a stick

Regardless of all the problems - because with a partner you fight - what made me separate from (my co-founder) was the difference in values... We also had many differences in terms of what company we wanted.
