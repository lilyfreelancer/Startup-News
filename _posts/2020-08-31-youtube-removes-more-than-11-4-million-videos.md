[More than 11.4 million videos have been removed from YouTube for violating the platform's rules](https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals?hl=en), a significant increase compared to the same period last year when only about nine million videos were removed. 

The reason for this high figure is due, as indicated by Youtube in a statement, to the fact that the platform has had to reduce its staff in offices due to the coronavirus, and therefore use more technology and algorithms controlling the content published on its website, "which means we are removing more content that may not infringe our policies," the company said.

Youtube had already warned in March, at the beginning of the quarantine, that its employees would work from home and that the technology would take over the review of the content published on the web, dispensing with human reviewers.

Youtube has also pointed out in this document that the country where most videos have been removed has been the United States, with more than two million, followed by India, with 1.4 million, Brazil, with more than 981,000, Indonesia, with more than 684,000 and Russia, with more than 406,000.

As for the reasons, Youtube has indicated that the majority of videos have been deleted for child safety, specifically 33.5 percent, followed by spam, with 28.3 percent, and for sexual content or nudity, with 14.6 percent.

But YouTube has not only deleted videos, but also channels, specifically 1.99 million channels in the last three months, in addition to 2,132 million comments that broke the rules contained in this platform.
