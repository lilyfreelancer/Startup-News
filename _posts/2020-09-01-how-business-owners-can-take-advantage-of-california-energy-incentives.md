Are you a small business owner in California? Now is the time to take advantage of energy incentives. 

By switching to solar energy, with the addition of a backup battery, California business owners can earn some great rebates for their business. Your solar installation can actually pay itself off within a year or two, and help you save for years to come!

Here’s what you need to know about [energy incentives for businesses in California](https://primesolarsolutions.com/commercial-solar-placer-ca/). 

## Install a backup battery

California battery backup for solar is the easiest way for your business to earn rebates. In some cases, the rebates you earn can even cover the entire cost of your battery installation!

The California Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) is an initiative to provide rebates for home and business owners who use distributed energy. If you use a backup battery with your solar, you could be eligible for a rebate of up to $250 per kilowatt-hour.

To put it simply: if you’re making the switch to solar for your business, you can add on a backup battery for basically no additional cost, and enjoy yearly rebates in the future.
