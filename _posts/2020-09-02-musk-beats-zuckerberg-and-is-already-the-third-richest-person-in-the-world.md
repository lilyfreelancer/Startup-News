[The tables are turning again on the ranking of the world's richest men. The multimillionaire Elon Musk, founder of Tesla or SpaceX, has just surpassed another figure of the technological giants such as Mark Zuckerberg, becoming the third richest person in the world.](https://www.msn.com/en-ae/news/other/elon-musk-beats-mark-zuckerberg-becomes-the-third-richest-man-in-the-world/ar-BB18Dwmq)

The change in this Bloomberg Billionaire Index has suffered this change thanks to the increase in the value of the shares that Tesla has experienced on the first working day of its "split". 

In this way, Musk currently has a wealth of nearly $111.3 billion, followed by nearly Zuckerberg, founder of the social network Facebook, which has a fortune valued at $110.5 billion.

Musk's rise in this ranking is due, above all, to the considerable increase in the value of Tesla's shares, which have appreciated by 475 percent so far this year, also increasing its wealth by 76,100 million dollars.

This ranking remains unchanged in the first positions that are occupied by the CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, with a wealth of $ 200,000 million. 

Now, these numbers in the fortunes of these billionaires can be changing thanks to the turns that their companies give in the stock market or the stock market, so it is expected that Musk continue to improve their wealth thanks to the compensation plan by objectives that has.
