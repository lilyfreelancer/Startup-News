75% of employees would rather have a bad boss than look for another job and earn less. Does this really come as a surprise to you?

A bad boss can cause the employee to feel uncomfortable at work, not to give his best, not to commit and not to feel valued, so what makes him stay at work and not submit his resignation?

According to a study by the resume advice site [ResumeLab](https://resumelab.com/career-advice/bad-boss), 75% of workers surveyed stay with a bad boss because they "couldn't afford a pay cut.

Thinking that things would get better was the reason 73% of respondents did not leave their job because they had a bad boss and 62% said they stayed because they liked the job and their co-workers.

The survey of more than 1,000 Americans who had to work with a bad boss also found that 48% of workers put up with a bad boss for only 1 or 2 years; however, 27% do so within 3-5 years and only 10% for five years or more.
