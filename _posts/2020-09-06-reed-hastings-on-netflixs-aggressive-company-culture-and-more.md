Reed Hastings is the multi-billionaire behind Netflix, and was directly responsible for quashing Blockbuster's entry into the modern entertainment market. They started with sending DVD's to now streaming through one of the largest tech operations in the world, sopping up a large portion of internet bandwidth in the United States.

I would highly recommend [checking out this internet with the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/style/reed-hastings-netflix-interview.html "checking out this internet with the New York Times") to learn more on what happens behind the scenes.
