[Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) has just announced the event where it expects to see the iPhone 12 and other products, just after discovering the hashtag prepared for the keynote on [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/).

    Looks like I was correct about there being a Press Release today, just not about what was in it.
