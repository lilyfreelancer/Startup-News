[Search engine giant Google announced this week the launch of Android 11](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/08/google-android-11-pixel-oneplus-xiaomi-oppo-realme-phones/), the latest version of its operating system for cell phones, one of the most anticipated updates in the industry, which will soon be available on a select number of devices.

According to the Google team, Android 11 has a series of improvements in the system's privacy, paying special attention to the section on privacy permissions when installing applications on our devices.

This means that it is now easier for the consumer to grant unique permissions when accessing the microphone, camera and our location, as well as to deny such access once the new update is implemented.
