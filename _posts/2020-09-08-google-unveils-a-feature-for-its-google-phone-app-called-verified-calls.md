This new Google feature is expected to let users know exactly which company they want to contact at all times.

  * On average, according to Google, a fraudulent call can cost the end consumer up to a thousand dollars
  * The new feature of Verified Calls was already tested for several months with limited users and brands, with good results
  * Specifically, Alphabet's subsidiary points out that this tool increases the rate of people who actually answer their phone

One of the most universally hated marketing and promotional strategies by the public is unwanted phone calls. There are companies that have call-centers dedicated to finding a random number and trying to promote products and services such as credit cards or telecommunication plans. Of course, most people simply block all these numbers, but it's not exactly a great strategy. Now, Google has created its solution.

According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/googles-new-verified-calls-feature-will-tell-you-why-a-business-is-calling-you/), Google has just introduced a new feature for Android phones, called Verified Calls. As the name implies, according to the brand's official blog, it is a tool that will display key information about legitimate businesses that are contacting the public. For example, the screen will display the brand name and logo, the reason for the conversation and a verification symbol that the company certified the data.
