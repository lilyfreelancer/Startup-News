[Walmart](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-09/walmart-tests-drone-delivery-amid-escalating-battle-with-amazon), the nation's largest retailer, has launched a pilot program in which it will use Flytrex drones in Faytteville, North Carolina, USA, for home delivery of groceries and commodities, and expects to gain insights into its customers' and workers' experience with the new methodology.

Walmart's vice president of customer products, Tom Ward, acknowledged that it will take time for drones to be widely used for package deliveries.

> "It still feels like a bit of science fiction, but we are at a point where we are learning more and more about the technology that is available and how we can use it to make our customers' lives easier," Ward wrote in a blog for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company.
