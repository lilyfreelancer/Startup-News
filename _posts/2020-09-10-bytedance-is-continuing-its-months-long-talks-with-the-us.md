TikTok's parent company, the Chinese company Bytedance, is discussing options with the U.S. government to avoid the complete sale of its U.S. operations, The [Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-u-s-discuss-ways-to-avoid-sale-11599680388?mod=djemalertNEWS)

According to the newspaper, the talks come after the urgency to seal a deal increased since China took a series of measures that make the operation more difficult.

ByteDance is rushing to find a buyer for TikTok's assets so that it can finalize a deal in mid-September to comply with President Donald Trump's order to divest them, after U.S. officials expressed concern about the security of U.S. citizen data handled by TikTok.
