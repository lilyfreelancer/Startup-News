[Facebook is launching a new online space](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/introducing-facebook-campus/) for college students to make it easier to connect with their classmates, share their notes and find campus updates.

This new space is a nod to the origins of Facebook, where students can access a supply of exclusive campus news and join groups, events and group chat rooms, and even have access to a "campus directory" where they can find and make new friends.

It's named Facebook Campus, and it targets approximately 200,000 students at 30 U.S. universities, including Brown University, California Institute of Technology, University of Louisville, Johns Hopkins University and Middlebury College.

Students will be able to create a profile far beyond their normal Facebook profile so that their classmates know what they are majoring in and what classes they are taking during the semester.

Facebook was originally created for college students. CEO and founder of the social network, Mark Zuckerberg, started this project in his dorm room at Harvard University in 2004. Then in 2006, Facebook allowed anyone over the age of 13 to join.
