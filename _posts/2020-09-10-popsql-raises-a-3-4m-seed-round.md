### What is PopSQL?

Popsql: Share queries by URL and organize them into folders.  
Stop sending SQL queries or pasting them into the chat. Simply share the URL to your query or results so your team can see your analysis. Create folders to organize your queries by project or department. Folders can be private for you or shared with your team.

Collaborate in real time, like a Google Doc.  
Stuck in a query? Send the link to a colleague and work together.

View your data automatically.  
PopSQL magically generates the best graph to visualize your data.

It works with many types of databases.  
PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, SQL Server, Redshift, Snowflake, SQLite, Presto, Cassandra, Oracle, ODBC and more on the go. Vote for the next database!
