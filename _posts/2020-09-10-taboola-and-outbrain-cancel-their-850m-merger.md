A massive merger of content recommendations falls apart, Microsoft reveals the release date and price of its flagship game console and Alexa allows phone calls for AT&T customers.

[It seems that the two largest companies in the content recommendations market will not be joining forces after all.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/?utm_source=angellist "It seems that the two largest companies in the content recommendations market will not be joining forces after all.")

Taboola and Outbrain announced an $850 million merger last year, but apparently a "challenging cultural adjustment" and the financial impact of the [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/) pandemic on the digital advertising business have spoiled the deal. There has not been a formal announcement yet, but Ingrid Lunden of TechCrunch has confirmed the news with both companies.

"We saw changing conditions in the marketplace because of COVID-19, and we decided to end the deal," an anonymous source told us.
