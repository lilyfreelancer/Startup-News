[Oracle reportedly won the bid to buy TikTok's US operations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/oracle-confirms-deal-with-tiktok-owner-bytedance-to-become-trusted-technology-provider.html), and Microsoft-Walmart's joint bid was rejected. Rather than being an outright owner, they are now a “trusted technology provider”.
