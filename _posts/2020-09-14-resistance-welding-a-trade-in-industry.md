You can’t even imagine of economical fabrication without welding. It plays a vital role in accommodating the various applications involved. Ranging from simple equipment to fully sophisticated automatic machines, the welding process has come a long way.

Resistance Welding is a mechanism that requires heat, time, current, and pressure to affix the metals. [Resistance Welding Soudax](https://soudax.com/en/resistance-welding/) provides a range of welding services to meet your needs on a commercial scale. Challenging materials like aluminum and hot-stamped high-strength steels demand advanced welding techniques. It is a widely used technique in the manufacturing industry. In addition to that, there are a plethora of industries that involve the welding process. For instance:

&#x2714; Aerospace Industry – The welding Process is used on a large scale in manufacturing airplanes and other aircraft. With the advancements in technology, MIG Welding is commonly used whereas Plasma Arc Welding and Electric Resistance Welding for an error-free job.

&#x2714; Automotive Industry – MIG Welding helps to deliver a super-strong bond for thinner metals. This welding process is cost-effective. It is a stapling mechanism in the field of automation.

&#x2714;Construction and Infrastructure – In the Construction industry, the welding process covers more than 70% of the residential and commercial buildings. Out of all, flux-cored welding with shielded metal-arc welding and plasma arc welding work well depending upon the project type.

&#x2714; Railroad Industry – More than 100 years ago, the welding process was used to join the rails. Spot Welding was always used to implement rail projects accurately.

&#x2714; Shipping Industry – Welding is a pivotal part to construct cruise liners, large tankers, cargo ships, and aircraft carriers. To continue with the gold standard in the shipping industry, welding helps to repair ships of all shapes and sizes.

## Advantages of Resistance Welding Process

&#x2714; Less process times

&#x2714; No consumables needed

&#x2714; Low voltage requirements

&#x2714;Excellent for sheet metal-based applications 

&#x2714; Environment friendly in approach

## Disadvantages of Resistance Welding Process

&#x2714;Require high-level electrode wear

&#x2714; Needs additional metal for lap joint

&#x2714; Power requirements

&#x2714; Low tensile strength

### Various forms of Resistance Welding Applications

Resistance Welding Machines are specially designed to make manufacturers' jobs quite easy to implement. It makes the construction process easily controllable. Let’s delve into its various forms:

&#x2714;Spot Welding and Seam Welding

&#x2714;Projection Welding

&#x2714; Flash Welding

&#x2714; Upset Welding

  * Resistance Spot Welding – In this process, the heat generated due to the flow of welding current is put into use. With its help, the workpieces are pushed together within a definite period. Face geometrics of the electrodes plays a significant role to adjust the welding current at the required weld location.

After providing enough resistance, the product materials set down and join that result in the formation of a weld nugget.

  * Resistance Seam Welding – It is primarily a subset of Resistance Spot Welding.

This type of welding works using wheel-shaped electrodes. These provide force

and welding current to the workpieces. The main function that differentiates it from Spot Welding is that the work part rolls within the electrodes when weld current is released. This type of welding thoroughly relies on weld current time settings. It leads to overlapping to form a complete welded seam.

  * Projection Welding – This welding type involves Resistance Welding Processes using projections, embossments, or intersections at predetermined points. The main focus is at generating heat at the point of contact. Creating adequate resistance at the point of contact gives rise to a weld nugget. For example, Cross-wire welding is performed using material intersections of wires and forms a weld nugget.

  * Flash Welding – It produces resistance utilizing flashing action. A very high current density is applied at very small contact points between the work parts.

Once the flashing process has begun, force is carried out to the workpiece and move ahead at a controlled rate. Rapid upset removes oxides and impurities from the welded part using this force.

  * Upset Welding – Just like the other welding processes, Upset Welding takes place with the help of heat, time, and pressure. Its process somehow resembles to flash welding except for the flashing action. The current is applied once the pressure is enforced. It continues until the process is complete.
