New movement in the 'Tik Tok' soap opera. [President Donald Trump has approved a deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-19/trump-says-he-s-approved-oracle-deal-for-u-s-tiktok-operations) allowing Silicon Valley giant Oracle to become TikTok's data partner to prevent the shutdown of the popular Chinese-owned video application that Washington has called a security risk.

The agreement, announced by the companies, also includes Walmart as a business partner and would create a new U.S. company called TikTok Global.

"I think it will be a fantastic deal," Trump said. "I've given the deal my blessing. If they make it, that's great, if they don't, that's fine too.

Shortly thereafter, TikTok , owned by China's ByteDance, confirmed the deal, which came with competing companies against a Sunday deadline set by Trump's management, after which further downloads of the application would be prohibited.
