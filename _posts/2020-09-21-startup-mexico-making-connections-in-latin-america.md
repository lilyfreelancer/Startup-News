Mexico was ranked 41st internationally and in regional terms in fourth place, preceded by Brazil, Chile and Argentina. One of the important actors within the Mexican ecosystem is Startup Mexico (SUM), a space for connection and advice that has incubated more than 652 startups.

Beyond the Mexican borders, SUM has [opened new headquarters in ParqueTec](https://www.startupmexico.com/blogs_es/blog-de-sum/startup-mexico-abrio-nuevo-campus-en-so-paulo), Costa Rica, with the purpose of contributing to the entry of startups from that country and vice versa. This happened previously with the opening of a campus in São Paulo, Brazil.
