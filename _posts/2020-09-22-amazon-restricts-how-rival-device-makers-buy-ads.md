As initially reported by the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-restricts-advertising-competitor-device-makers-roku-arlo-11600786638), Amazon will be mitigating the competition against their own devices like door bells and smart speaker being sold on their platform. This comes at a time where smaller device makers depend on buying ad-spots on Amazon rather than selling and distributing independently.

_"News flash: retailers promote their own products and often don't sell products of competitors," said Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener in a written statement. "Walmart refuses to sell [Amazon brands] Kindle, Fire TV, and Echo. Shocker. In the Journal's next story they will uncover gambling in Las Vegas."_
