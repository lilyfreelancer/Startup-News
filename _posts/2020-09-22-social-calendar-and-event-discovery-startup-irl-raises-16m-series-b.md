Via [Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/irl-fuels-social-calendar-app-with-16m-series-b/):

> With many events capped at a certain attendance number to allow for social distancing, it’s more difficult to celebrate and connect. IRL (In Real Life) is out to change that.
> 
> The San Francisco-based startup raised a $16 million Series B round of funding to further develop its free social calendar and event discovery platform that brings people together over shared experiences.
> 
> Goodwater Capital led the round with participation from Founders Fund, Floodgate and Raine. The new financing gives IRL a total of $28 million raised since the company was founded in 2017. That includes an $8 million Series A round from 2019 that was also led by Goodwater, according to Crunchbase data.
> 
> The new funding will be used to build out IRL’s web product and expand the platform internationally. The platform’s first version came out in June 2019, and has grown 10 times since, Abraham Shafi, founder and CEO, told Crunchbase News.
> 
> “The most important thing we are tracking is time spent on the app because that not only shows usage and revenue drive, but for us it is time together,” Shafi said.
