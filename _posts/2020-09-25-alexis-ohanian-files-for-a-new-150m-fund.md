According to a [public SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1825205/000182520520000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml), Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, is raising a new fund called 776. The new goal is to receive $150 million in a fund tied to the Olympic Games, and he even launced a related website dubbeed sevensevensix.com.

This also comes at a time when Alexis had left his previous VC firm, Initialized Capital, to work on other tech funding initiatives.
