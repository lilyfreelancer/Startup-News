The GSMA has announced that the Mobile World Congress 2021 will be delayed. Instead of being held in February, the event has been postponed until the end of June. Will this decision affect new product launches?

Last February, despite the fact that the threat of coronavirus was seen as a distant one in Western countries, a large number of the industry's leading exhibitors and manufacturers decided not to attend MWC 2020 to ensure the health of their workers and customers. 

The spate of casualties prompted the GSMA, the association of operators and brands organizing the event, to announce the cancellation of the Mobile World Congress after a few weeks of uncertainty. While the decision was quite controversial at the time, it is clear from the past and from the scope of the pandemic that it was the right one. 

Despite the fact that next February is still a long way off, this time the GSMA did not want to get its fingers caught and has already made a decision regarding the Mobile World Congress 2021. Although we are not in the critical situation that was experienced between March and May, the [covid-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/) continues to be a threat whose containment requires measures of social distance. For this reason, the organization has decided to postpone its celebration until next summer.

10 curiosities about the Mobile World Congress that you probably didn't know  
The Mobile World Congress is a global event where each year more than 2,400 companies from 200 countries, nearly 5,000 executives and CEOs, and more than 100,000 visitors attend. This melting pot of cultures and technology, over 33 years, has given rise to all kinds of curiosities and anecdotes.

Specifically, the GSMA has rescheduled its schedule of events: it will hold MWC 2021 in Shanghai from February 23 to 25, and MWC 2021 in Barcelona will take place from June 28 to July 1. 

"With an ever-changing global perspective and after consultation with our board, members and key exhibitors, we have made the careful decision to reschedule MWC21 Shanghai in February and MWC21 Barcelona in June. The health and safety of our exhibitors, attendees, staff and people in Barcelona are of paramount importance," GSMA Managing Director Mats Granryd [said in a statement.](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/gsma-announces-date-changes-for-its-mwc21-series/)
