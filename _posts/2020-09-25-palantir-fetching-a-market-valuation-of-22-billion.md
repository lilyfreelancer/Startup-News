From [Crunchbase News](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/briefing-9-25-20/):

> Data and analytics software company Palantir is reportedly expecting to fetch a market valuation of around $22 billion after it completes a public market debut planned for next week.
> 
> The company has opted for a direct listing in lieu of a traditional IPO, and is reportedly expecting shares to price for around $10 apiece. At that price point, Palantir would be valued above its recent valuations in private markets.
