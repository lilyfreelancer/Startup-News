From the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-expected-to-be-valued-at-nearly-22-billion-in-trading-debut-11600990739?mod=djemalertNEWS):

> Palantir Technologies Inc. is expected to fetch a lofty valuation in its transition to a public company despite an unusually aggressive governance structure, in the latest sign of investors’ voracious appetite for new shares.
> 
> The data-mining-software specialist is eschewing the traditional IPO route and going public through a direct listing, in which a company floats its existing shares on a public exchange and lets the market determine the price. Ahead of a debut planned for September 30, Palantir’s bankers have told investors the shares could start trading around $10 apiece, according to people familiar with the matter. That equates to a market valuation of nearly $22 billion on a fully diluted basis.
