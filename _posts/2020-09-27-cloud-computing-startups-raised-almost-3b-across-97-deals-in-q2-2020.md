Cloud-computing startups have been in high-demand during the coronavirus pandemic, as large businesses need their services to keep up with the huge wave of competition.

In particular, startups dedicated to app security, networking and storage, and databases have received most of the funding.

97 funding deals were made during the second quarter, up from 76 during the same period in 2019. This amounts to over $3 billion in funding.
