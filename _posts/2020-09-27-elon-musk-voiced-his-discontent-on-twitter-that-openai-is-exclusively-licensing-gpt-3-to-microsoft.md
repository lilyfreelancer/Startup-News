As we [previously covered](https://new.blicio.us/microsoft-teams-up-with-openai-to-exclusively-license-gpt-3/), Microsoft announced that it was exclusively licensing GPT-3, a natural language [AI](https://new.blicio.us/why-artificial-intelligence-is-still-not-that-intelligent/)-powered tool made by OpenAI.

The announcement was met with some dismay by AI enthusiasts, taking this as OpenAI going agaist the mission statement of making AI available to all. Elon Musk, who co-founded the company as a non-profit AI research body, was among those annoyed by this.

While the [original tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20200924153540/https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1309052632850468864) was deleted, it was straightforward:

    This does seem like the opposite of open. OpenAI is essentially captured by Microsoft.
