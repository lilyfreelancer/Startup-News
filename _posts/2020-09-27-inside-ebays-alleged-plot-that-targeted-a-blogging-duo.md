“People are basically good” was the founding principple of eBay, but the actions of a few rouge employees had demonstrated quite the opposite.

Going all the [way back to June](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457487/go-read-this-ebay-stalking-harassment-new-york-times?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4), authorities in Massachusetts were charging six eBay employees in connection with a gruesome harassment campaign of a couple who ran an e-commerce blog & newsletter.

David Streitfeld from The New York Times spoke with one of them, Veronica Zea, who said she plans to plead guilty. While pleading guilty doesn't mean everything is true, the messed up details of the story makes you wonder why anyone would risk their job for such insanity.

  * The couple had their home address leaked, their car followed by someone in disguise, and had pizzas delivered at all hour. There were also plans to place a GPS tracking device on their car, but it never got to that point.
  * The Steiners received a book titled “Grief Diaries: Surviving the Loss of a Spouse”, implying that one of them may be harmed.
  * Pornographic magazines were "accidentally" delviered to their neighbors in the Steiners' name.
  * Boxes of larvae, spiders, and cockroache were delivered to their house.

For more details, I suggest checking out the piece published at the [New York Times.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/technology/ebay-cockroaches-stalking-scandal.html)
