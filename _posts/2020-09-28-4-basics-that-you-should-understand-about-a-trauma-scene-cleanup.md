## Trauma Scenes Require a Strong Stomach

It’s one thing to watch a gory scene in a movie. Things are different when you have to step into one in real life. The combination of what you see, the smell, and the general feeling of being in the space is sometimes more than people can handle. It’s not a place where you want to be.

Professionals who have dealt with trauma scenes in the past have developed skills that help them cope with the sights, smells, and other aspects of the setting. Why put yourself through being at the scene when others can handle the cleanup?

## There’s Plenty of Health Hazards Too

If you could steel yourself to what the scene looks like, does that mean you should proceed with the cleaning on your own? Not at all! There are still health hazards that must be considered.

A trauma scene is likely to include the presence of different kinds of body fluids. There’s also the matter of traces of decomposing flesh, and possibly other threats. Do you know how to adequately protect yourself from these hazards? If you hesitate to answer, that’s one more sign that you should leave the cleanup in the hands of professionals.

## Deep Cleaning is the Only Way to Go

Any trauma scene cleanup requires deep cleaning. It also must be exhaustive cleaning that leaves no square inch of the space untouched. It’s necessary to locate the smallest blood splatter and find the tiniest remnant of human flesh. That requires an eye for detail that not everyone possesses.

You also need equipment that can aid in the deep cleaning. Professionals who have handled trauma scenes in the past know what it takes and how to find the most minute traces of contamination. When the team is done, the space will be completely clean.

## Household Cleaners Won’t Do

Even the cleaning agents used with trauma scene cleanings are different from what you use around the house. Of necessity, they must be more concentrated to do the job. That also means knowing how to utilize those products safely. You can bet that someone who has dealt with all sorts of scenes will know what type of protective garb to wear and how to make use of any type of cleaning product. That expertise will allow the professional to handle the cleaning safely, quickly, and thoroughly.

You don’t have to know all the specifics of how a trauma scene is actually cleaned.
