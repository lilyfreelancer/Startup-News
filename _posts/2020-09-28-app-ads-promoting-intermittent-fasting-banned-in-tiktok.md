TikTok, the social network of the moment, has introduced some changes in its advertising policy and will now restrict ads for [applications promoting intermittent fasting and weight loss supplements.](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/coming-together-to-support-body-positivity-on-tiktok)

TikTok's intention, as explained in a statement, is to "support body positivity" on the music video platform that is proving very successful, especially among young people, and to protect "the community from harmful content and behavior. 

Similarly, TikTok will also increase restrictions on advertisements that promote a "harmful or negative" body image.

In TikTok's opinion, these advertisements do not support "the positive, inclusive and safe experience" that the social network seeks.

But it won't stop there, it will go further and have new advertising policies to combat problematic and exaggerated claims for diet and weight loss products, as well as for weight loss claims and body image references.

To this end, the social network will ensure that weight control products only reach users over the age of 18 and will increase restrictions for weight control claims.

As for ads promoting weight loss products or services, they will not be able to promote a negative body image or a negative relationship with food.

TikTok has partnered with the National Association of Eating Disorders in the United States to help users seeking support with important resources to do so through the platform.

In addition, TikTok users will be able to report advertisements or content that promotes harmful food-related behavior. Reporting this type of content will be very simple, just click on the video in question for a few seconds and the option to "report" and then "self-harm" will appear, so that the app is aware that this content may violate the rules.
