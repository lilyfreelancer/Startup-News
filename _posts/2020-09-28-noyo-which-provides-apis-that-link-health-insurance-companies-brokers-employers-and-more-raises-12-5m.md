Noyo, a startup that provides APIs to health insurance companies & users, [announced that it obtained $12.5 million in a Series A round of funding](https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/noyo-announces-12-5m-in-series-a-financing-and-new-partnerships-with-ameritas-humana-15441638). This funding event was led by Costanoa Ventures and Spark Capital, a San Francisco Venture Capital Firm that is known to back big game changing tech companies in Silicon Valley.

The company also disclosed new partnerships with leading insurance carriers like Humana and Ameritas. The goal is to help the customer experience of policy holders, and to make the enrollment process even smoother.

"Noyo is doing something totally new and exciting in our space, and we're confident that better industry connections will lead to a great health insurance experience," says Gary Davis, Humana's National Leader for General Agents, Digital Initiatives, & Small Business Sales. "We have already seen how working with Noyo drives down enrollment costs and improves speed and accuracy at a critical time for Americans needing health insurance coverage."
