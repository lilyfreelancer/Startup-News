Spain hosts a total of 215 incubators and accelerators, which are estimated to employ 1,376 people. On average, these ecosystem agents receive 121.1 applications per year and their main source of resources is space rental, as revealed in the first report on the impact of incubators and accelerators in Spain.

For these agents, the most important services they offer are assistance and training in management, provision of space and access to funding. The startups with significant social and environmental impact that are in these programs work mainly in the sectors of social tourism and responsible consumption.

The authors of the study are [Social Innovation Monitor](https://socialinnovationmonitor.com/en/spain-incubators/) (SIM), an international research team based at the Politecnico di Torino, which together with the Spanish Association of Startups has published this report, which can be downloaded by clicking on this link.

The research team, which had already produced similar reports in Italy in recent years, provides an overview of the geographical distribution of incubators and accelerators in Spain, analyzes the legal nature and different types of accelerators/incubators, and gives an insight into the services offered, as well as the differences between different acceleration and incubation programs.

In particular, as explained in a joint statement, it provides an overview of the characteristics and challenges faced by acceleration and incubation programs that support startups and entrepreneurs who promote projects that have a significant social and environmental impact.

Spain was not the only country analyzed by the Social Innovation Monitor (SIM) research team. A report with aggregated data on incubators and accelerators in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK will be published for the first time in the coming weeks.
