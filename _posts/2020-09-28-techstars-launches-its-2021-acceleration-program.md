Techstars, the global investment and innovation platform, is calling on Latin American startups to apply to its Techstars Boulder acceleration program to be developed remotely during 2021.

[Techstars Boulder](www.techstars.com/accelerators/boulder) offers a 3-month program and up to $120,000 in funding per company. In addition, lifetime access to its global network of entrepreneurs, including more than 10,000 mentors, investors, and 1,600 companies that have graduated from its acceleration programs.

Since its founding in 2007, the Techstars Boulder program has helped more than 150 companies that have raised more than $1 billion to take their business to the next level. Entrepreneurs who have been part of the acceleration program include DigitalOcean and Sendgrid.

Recently, Techstars Boulder announced Colombian entrepreneur Andres Barreto as Managing Director of its acceleration program. Barreto is the founder of Grooveshark, Onswipe, Socialatom Group, Firstrock Capital and Coderise.org and through his investment firm, launched, advised and financed over 85 portfolio companies in Latin America and the United States.

"The Internet has made it easier to create from wherever the best talent is found, and by 2020 it has normalized money collection and sales to clients through video calls. In that sense, Techstars Boulder is becoming remote to fund and support the best founders, wherever they are," says Andr√©s Barreto, Managing Director of Techstars Boulder.
