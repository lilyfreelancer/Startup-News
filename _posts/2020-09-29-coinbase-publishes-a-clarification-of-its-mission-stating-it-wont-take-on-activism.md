As a seemingly unusual decision in the current political climate, Coinbase announced their stance against [corporate activisim in a recent blog post](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-twitter-coinbase-corporate-activism).

The CEO stated that heir employees need to remain “laser focused” on the company’s mission: to create an open financial system for the world. This means they will avoid touching social or political topics, whether publicly or internally, and stick to pure business.
