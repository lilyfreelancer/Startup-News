The Vienna-based cryto brokerage Bitpanda had [announced the completion of a $52 million series A](https://tech.eu/brief/austrian-cryptocurrency-trading-platform-bitpanda-raises-52-million-from-peter-thiels-valar-ventures-others/), led by Valar Ventures. If you include their past funding rounds since 2016, they've rased over $100 million in total.

According to data from CoinGecko, Bitpanda Pro handles around $2 million in daily volume. If you factor in their precious metal trading, they had over a $1 billion in volume in 2019.

Eric Demuth, CEO of Bitpanda, had this to say:

> “This investment from Valar Ventures is a major vote of confidence in Bitpanda and our vision from one of the world’s pre-eminent investors in successful fintech companies. By using industry-leading technology and building innovative financial tools, we’re democratising investing and giving everyone access to the financial markets, no matter their financial means. We are making it possible for everyone to take ownership of their financial future and are providing our customers with financial knowledge and education in the process. Our goal is to become the leading investment and trading platform in Europe, not only for the people who are already familiar with trading but for everyone. This funding will help us do just that and, crucially, continue to recruit some of the world’s leading talent to our team.”
