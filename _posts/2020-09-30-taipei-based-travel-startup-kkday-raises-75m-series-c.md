Taiwan-based travel startup KKday [has raised](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/travel-activities-platform-kkday-raises-75-million-series-c-as-it-focuses-on-staycations/) a $75 million Series C, led by Cool Japan Fund and National Development Fund, with additional participation from other investment groups.

The new round of funding was requested to expand and develop their booking management platform for tour guides, which is set to launch in both Taiwan and Japan.

“In our relentless pursuit to provide the best and seamless experience for any traveler, [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/) has pushed us to innovate,” says Chen Ming-ming, founder and CEO of KKday.
