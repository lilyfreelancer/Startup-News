[BooBoo](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/booboo) is able to detect in real time the most suitable transport solution in terms of service, cost and sustainability. Its founder and CEO, Juan Miguel Moreno, relies on Artificial Intelligence to optimize the processes that this traditional sector "was not taking advantage of". In 2018 this platform with a wink to Dragon Ball raised 400,000 euros in its first round of funding. Now expects to close the second this quarter.

BooBoo operates as a national logistics marketplace that has tattooed the digitalization in all its processes. "It is not a comparator," says Moreno, who defends that the platform operates, is responsible and accountable for each service in the first person. It is a digital logistics operator for e-commerce stores, producers and distributors.
