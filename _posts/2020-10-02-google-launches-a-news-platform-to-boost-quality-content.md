Google is launching a new platform that seeks to prioritize and enhance quality content over other types of news, such as the viral, non-informative, ringing news. This is the Google News Showcase, which has already been presented in different countries.

Specifically, with the support of different media, a number of news of high journalistic value will be published through this platform. In return, Google will pay the companies that are part of this experience. 

The bet is such that Alphabet, Google's parent company, is going to allocate about 1,000 million dollars in salaries over the next three years.

According to Alphabet's CEO, Sundar Pichai, the first experiences will take place in Germany and Brazil, with Der Spiegel, Stern, Die Zeit, Folha de S. Paulo, Band and Infobae. Later on, about 200 media from all over the world will join in.

One of the attractions of this next global information giant will be the almost absence of advertising, since they assure that many of their contents will have no publicity whatsoever, something that can give more freedom to news editors.

According to Google [in a statement](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase), the News Showcase builds on the existing news licensing program, which is already paying publishers for quality journalism, and "will give readers more context and perspective on important news stories and generate high-value traffic to a publisher's site.
