According to the [Coinbase Blog](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-now-offers-instant-withdrawals-c61fe8213555):

> Starting today, Coinbase offers instant withdrawals in nearly 40 countries including the US, UK, and more across Europe. Customers in the US, UK, and Europe can withdraw funds with a linked Visa debit card. In the US, customers will be able to also withdraw funds with their Mastercard.

For some users, the accouncement is far from perfect:
