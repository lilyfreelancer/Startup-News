In [Neuron's offical blog](https://www.rideneuron.com/neuron-raises-fresh-capital-to-fuel-exciting-expansion-plans/), the company had announced their latest funding round that had amounted to $12 million being raised. Their total funding thus far is $30.5 million, and the company expects accelerated growth due to [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/).

The company is currently renting scooters in both Australia and New Zealand, within the towns of Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra, Townsville and Auckland.
