Only six days after Uber won its appeal against London transportation regulators in London, extendign it for 1 1/2 years, the same cannot be said for Ola. This Indian-based rival startup didn't meet safety requirements when trying to take a stake in the market.

[Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/tfl-bans-uber-rival-ola-over-public-safety-failings-12090283) had mentioned the faults of Ola early on, foreshadowing their denial by local authorities. They uncovered unlicensed drivers and vehicles covering more than 1,000 passenger trips, â€œwhich may have put passenger safety at risk".
