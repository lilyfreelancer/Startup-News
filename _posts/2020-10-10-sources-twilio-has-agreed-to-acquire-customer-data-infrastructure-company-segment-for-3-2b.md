According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/10/09/twilio-to-acquire-cloud-startup-segment-for-3-billion/), a $3.2 billion deal has been made for Twilio to acquire the operations of Segment. Since cloud services are in high demand, I think we will see similar multi-billion dollar deals by the end of the quarter.
