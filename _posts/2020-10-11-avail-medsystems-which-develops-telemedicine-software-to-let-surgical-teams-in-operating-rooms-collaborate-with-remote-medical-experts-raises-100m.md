According to [Crunchbase News](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/tapping-into-remote-experts-avail-medsystems-raises-100m-for-telemedicine-platform/):

> Medical technology company Avail Medsystems, which develops telemedicine software for the procedure room, raised $100 million in Series B funding.

< D1 Capital Partners led the round with participation from 8VC and existing investors. The new funding gives the Palo Alto-based company a total of $125 million in funding since it was started in 2018. This includes a $25 million in Series A and Series A-1 funding, according to Crunchbase data.

Avail claims to have “the only end-to-end system that helps surgical teams in operating rooms collaborate with remote medical experts for live procedures and clinical training.” This comes critical when this pandemic has enforced social distancing between medical staff.
