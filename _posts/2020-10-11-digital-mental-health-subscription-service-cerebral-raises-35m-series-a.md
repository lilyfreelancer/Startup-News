According to the announcement on [Mobi Health News](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/digital-mental-health-subscription-service-cerebral-lands-35m "Mobi Health News"), Digital mental health raised $35 million in funding, which will be used towards their expansion in all 50 US states.

### What are they about?

Cerebral offers a membership subscription for telehealth visits for patients. Since regular therapy sessions have been stifled due to the pandemic, this allows them an outlet to talk with a care counselor.
