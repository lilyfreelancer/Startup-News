According to their announcement on [CoinList](https://blog.coinlist.co/flow-raises-18m-on-coinlist/):

> We are excited to announce the successful close of the Flow public sale, which raised $18M across both the community sale and auction from nearly 13,000 participants.

The sale went in 2 phases: the "Community Phase" and the Auction to liquidate their tokens.
