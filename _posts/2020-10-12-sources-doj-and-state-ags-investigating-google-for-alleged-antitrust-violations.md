According to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/10/feds-may-target-googles-chrome-browser-for-breakup-428468):

> Justice Department and state prosecutors investigating Google for alleged antitrust violations are considering whether to force the company to sell its dominant Chrome browser and parts of its lucrative advertising business, three people with knowledge of the discussions said Friday.
> 
> The conversations — amid preparations for an antitrust legal battle that DOJ is expected to begin in the coming weeks — could pave the way for the first court-ordered break-up of a U.S. company in decades. The forced sales would also represent major setbacks for Google, which uses its control of the world’s most popular web browser to aid the search engine that is the key to its fortunes.
> 
> Discussions about how to resolve Google’s control over the $162.3 billion global market for digital advertising remain ongoing, and no final decisions have been made, the people cautioned, speaking anonymously to discuss confidential discussions. But prosecutors have asked advertising technology experts, industry rivals and media publishers for potential steps to weaken Google’s grip.

    DoJ wants Google to sell Chrome for interesting reasons. Any privacy changes Chrome makes to reduce tracking hurts advertisers so they're always suspect even if Mozilla/<a href="https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/">Apple</a> do the same thing. <a href="https://t.co/8BJwYGzuUl">https://t.co/8BJwYGzuUl</a>

    In my opinion, framing a privacy issue as a market dominance problem is a mistake. In a monopoly of data collection-and-exploitation what first needs to be fixed is not the monopoly part... <a href="https://t.co/vZ39Dur7Pu">https://t.co/vZ39Dur7Pu</a>
