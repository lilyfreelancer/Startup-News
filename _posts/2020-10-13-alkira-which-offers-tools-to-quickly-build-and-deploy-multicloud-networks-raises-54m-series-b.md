Alkira, a startup leading the Networking-as-a-service trend, raised $54 million in a recent Series B round of funding. This puts their total at $76 million.

The company produces an easy to use point & click service for enterprises to set up their cloud servers.

“After 40 minutes your whole cloud infrastructure is up and running,” Alkira Chief Executive Officer Amir Khan (pictured) told SiliconANGLE’s video studio theCUBE in an interview in April.
