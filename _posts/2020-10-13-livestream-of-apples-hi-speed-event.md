[Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) Inc. is expected to unveil Tuesday an iPhone capable of connecting to faster fifth-generation (5G) networks, a new feature designed to stimulate sales during the company's busiest sales quarter.

The event comes nearly a month later than usual and is marked by a coronavirus pandemic that has altered Apple's machine for the design and production of its best-selling product.

Wall Street analysts expect Apple to introduce four new iPhones at the event, which will be broadcast from its headquarters in Cupertino, California, starting at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT). (<https://www.apple.com/apple-events/>)

Two will be "Pro" models that are expected to have more camera sensors and a higher quality screen, and one will come in a large version for big screen fans.  
In the middle is likely to be an iPhone 12 with the broadest appeal: A large enough screen and enough cameras to satisfy most Apple fans, with a more attractive price.

Finally, analysts expect that Apple will once again offer a smaller screen model of its flagship phone after several years of relegating those who prefer smaller devices to earlier models.

The iPhones to be announced on Tuesday will test whether Apple can maintain the streak and generate a wave of consumer enthusiasm for 5G mobile networks, whose faster variants exceed the data transfer rates of their predecessors by several times.
