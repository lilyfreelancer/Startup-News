The technological giant Microsoft will allow its employees to work from home permanently, establishing a kind of hybrid workplace in which both forms, home and office, are combined.

As Microsoft [explained in a statement](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/10/09/embracing-a-flexible-workplace/), the goal for employees in the future is "to offer the greatest possible flexibility to support individual work styles, while balancing business needs.

This way, employees of this company will be able to work from home for less than 50 percent of their work week, but it also includes that managers can approve teleworking on a permanent basis.

However, this will depend on the role that each worker plays in the company, so some will still have to go to the office on a mandatory basis, such as those who require access to hardware labs, data centers and in-person training. However, employees will have the option of choosing more flexible schedules without the need for these changes to be approved by the manager. 

Another line included in the guide sent by Microsoft to its employees is that they will also be able to relocate nationally or even internationally if teleworking can be done without problems, although it must be previously approved by the manager. 

Similarly, Microsoft has committed to pay home office expenses for those who decide to work from home, but territorial relocation expenses will not be covered.

Microsoft's decision to pursue greater flexibility for some of its office work comes months after the company notified its employees that its U.S. offices would be closed until January 2021 at the earliest. The company allowed its workers to work from home in March, before the pandemic caused many facilities to close. 

Microsoft is not the only technology company that has allowed its employees to work from home, as Facebook has done so as well, and is extending this remote working measure to thousands of its workers.
