A rival to TikTok, Triller, is skyrocketing in venture capital, proving that the platform is not unbeatable.

According to [Tech in Asia](https://www.techinasia.com/delving-vietnams-hidden-unicorn):

> TikTok rival mulls going public  
> American video-sharing social network and entertainment platform Triller, which is a direct rival of TikTok, is reportedly in discussions with blank-check acquisition companies about a merger that would take the company public, says people familiar with the matter. This comes at a time when TikTok and its parent company ByteDance are facing challenges both in the US and elsewhere in the world.
