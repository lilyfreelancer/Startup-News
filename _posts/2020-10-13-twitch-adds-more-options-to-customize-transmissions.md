[Twitch Studio](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2020/10/12/twitch-studio-updates-new-tools-to-help-you-stream-like-a-pro/) is updated with new features that will make it easier for streamers to customize the dynamics of their transmissions.

The [Twitch](https://new.blicio.us/how-twitch-got-started-what-happened-to-justin-tv/) streaming app continues to add options that allow different details of the broadcasts to be configured taking into account the needs of the streamers and their followers.

One of the novelties of this update is that the streamer will be able, with just dragging and dropping elements, to change the scenes to adapt them to a certain moment of the broadcast or to the needs of its audience. For example, for a chat overlay. If the streamer wants the comments of your followers to become more relevant in the broadcast, you can adjust the interface so that the chat appears on screen.

On the other hand, there is also a bonus that will help streamers to gain audience before their broadcasts. From this update, Twitch Studio allows to integrate a countdown timer in the transmissions. An option that usually generates expectations by alerting users that the streamer is about to transmit and how much time is left before the transmission.
