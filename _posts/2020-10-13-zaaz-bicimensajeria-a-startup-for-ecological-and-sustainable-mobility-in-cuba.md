For Lisa del Prado, riding a bicycle is a hobby that now makes her a startup for ecological and sustainable mobility in Cuba. It is [Zaaz Bicimensajería](https://www.facebook.com/zaazbicimensajeria.cuba/), a service "personalized, flexible, with payment facilities and the confidence of the bicycle messengers," she describes. 

She used her bicycle to deliver the orders for Mi Rinconcito-her creative art and recycling workshop venture-as a result of problems linked to lack of transportation, and then reduced mobility due to the pandemic. And then, if she did, she wondered why not create a bicycle messaging community that would help businesses and citizens.
