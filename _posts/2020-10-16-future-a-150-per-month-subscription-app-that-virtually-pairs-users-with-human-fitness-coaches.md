According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/future-raises-24m-series-b-for-its-150-mo-exercise-app-amid-at-home-fitness-boom/), Future, one of the hottest fitness apps on app stores, raised $24 million in a series B round of funding. It was led by Trustbridge Partners, with Caffeinated Capital and Kleiner Perkins participating again.

## What are they about?

A personal trainer on your smartphone for only $150 a month  
For "only" 150 bucks a month, we can subscribe to this application, assigning us a personal and online trainer who will be watching over us, sending us messages and making sure we perform all the exercises without exception. And how do you control us? Well, very simply, with the 150 dollars a month that it costs to subscribe to this application, Future sends us an [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) Watch to avoid lying to our trainer. A plan without fissures.

According to its CEO, Rishi Mandal, and as stated by TechCrunch, the application comes with a money-back guarantee in case it does not meet the user's requirements, but so far only one user has requested it.

The operation of Future is very simple. When we register, we will be given a questionnaire about our goals -if we want to lose weight, build muscle, etc.- and we will choose an expert trainer that fits our needs. After that, we will have an interview with this trainer to get to know each other, at the same time that he will explain our schedule of activities as well as elaborate our own personalized plan. After the Apple Watch arrives at our house, we can start the plan that our personal trainer has elaborated for us.

Future sponsors include Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram as well as famous sports stars such as basketball and NFL players.
