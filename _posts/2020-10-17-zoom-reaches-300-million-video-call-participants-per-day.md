Zoom, the videoconferencing platform that has become a star in the world of teleworking, has ensured that 300 million people participate in its meetings every day. 

This is a fairly high figure, although nothing compared to the minutes of meetings held at Zoom, some three billion minutes. 

The platform, which has begun working with optional end-to-end encryption, has indicated in its Zoomtopia 2020 event that more than 125,000 educational centers are using Zoom to give classes or solve doubts during these times when teleworking is reigning over everything, especially because of the coronavirus crisis.

During this event, Zoom has also announced the launch of OnZoom, an online events platform for users to host free and paid events.

Similarly, Zoom also offers a new attendee control panel, which will begin this week in its beta version but only for the United States.

As for end-to-end encryption, Zoom has explained that it will be optional and that it can only be used in technical preview for both free and paid Zoom users.

This encryption means that users will have their messages protected through cryptographic keys that will only be recognized by the participants' devices.
