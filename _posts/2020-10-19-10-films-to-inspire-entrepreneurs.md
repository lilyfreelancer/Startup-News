An adventure that Cruise follows and takes him to work in Jamaica, where he meets a girl who is on vacation on the island.

## Women's Weapons (Mike Nichols, 1988)

Ambition is also a woman's thing. Tell that to Tess, a young New Yorker played by Melanie Griffith, who is willing to pursue her dream of becoming someone in the corporate world. To do so, she will have to face her boss and her demands, but little by little her intelligence and her way of doing things will help her build a better future, even if it is based on trickery and lies.

## The Aviator (John Logan, 2004)

This film tells the biography of Howard Hughes, one of America's most famous businessmen. In fact, he was one of the most prominent producers in Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s and was responsible for launching actresses like Jean Harlow into stardom. But he also had other aspirations, and was one of the great drivers of innovations in the world of aviation, for which he felt a great fascination.

## In search of happiness (Gabriel Muccino, 2006)

Effort and tenacity characterize the character played by Will Smith, Chris Gardner, who despite the difficulties manages to make a name for himself and be recognized by his bosses and colleagues.

It is during his free time that the idea of Facebook is born, a company that he formed with other colleagues, with whom he would later have legal and also personal difficulties, especially after the accusation that he stole the idea from some students of his same university and his relationship with Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), his old friend and co-founder of Facebook.
