SpaceX, the American aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, has just launched a new collection of satellites into space as part of its project to provide the Internet to all parts of the world, so there are already about 800 satellites orbiting the earth.

The launch of the Starlink satellites with Internet transmission took place on Sunday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, in the United States, and was made on board the Falcon 9 rocket, which had already been used in previous missions such as the first Crew Dragon demonstration mission to the International Space Station, the launch of the Radarsat constellation mission and three Starlink missions so far this year. 

Shortly after the launch, the Falcon 9 rocket returned to earth and its first stage was recovered after a successful controlled landing. 

The intention of SpaceX is to install a network of 12,000 satellites in orbit around the Earth, and to this end the different launches are taking place. The mission is expected to be completed in 2027 so they are already one step closer to it. 

The company has plans to launch at least two more batches during the next month, including a launch scheduled for this Wednesday, according to TechCrunch. With this one, SpaceX has 14 satellite launches to provide greater Internet coverage around the world and is known as Starlink.
