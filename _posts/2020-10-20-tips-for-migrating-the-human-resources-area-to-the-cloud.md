The changes that have taken place in recent months have put even more focus on the digital transformation that the Human Resources (HR) areas have been undergoing, and especially on the adoption of Cloud solutions for Payroll and Human Resources due to their flexibility and efficiency, which undoubtedly break with the usual practices of organizations when they decide to incorporate them.

The evolution of in-house solutions to the cloud must be done through a methodology. The first measures and key steps that must be taken to successfully adopt cloud tools in the areas of HR are the following:

Understand the organization and audit the HR technology needs. Choosing the right solution with high configuration capacity is of utmost importance, especially for companies with great complexity in their processes and operating in several countries. To carry out the correct selection and the best configuration, phase analysis should be considered:

  * Consult the needs of HR "customers"; managers, employees and end users: what would they like to change? What aspects of their current tools would they like to maintain?
  * Auditing current and future technological needs: For example, the digitalization of invoices can be considered as the previous step before the implementation of a platform where suppliers present their invoices.
  * Integrate the IT ecosystem: What other tools and services does the current solution communicate with? All services must be involved in the preparation of a list of IT tools and databases that must be integrated with the new cloud solution.
  * Analyze the technology: What tasks can now be automated or digitized? Through Artificial Intelligence, more and more tasks related to HR can be streamlined.

## Criteria for choosing a trusted cloud provider

Once the needs have been identified, it is time to analyze the main criteria to be considered in the selection of the HR cloud provider

  * Regulatory compliance: Check whether the cloud provider's offered infrastructure complies with all country regulations such as ISO standards, data confidentiality and all legislation related to data management.
  * Hosting quality: Choose a provider whose infrastructure is located in a data center that operates with the highest standards of reliability and security to provide 24-hour service.
  * Ergonomics and ease of use: Employees will spend many hours using the chosen tool, so their productivity and ease of use depends on the ergonomics of the interface.
  * Compatibility: The chosen solution must be able to communicate fluently with the other tools in the company and interpret all the documents available so far.
  * Security: Security guarantees are decisive criteria for the choice of the cloud service provider, since it will be the final responsible for the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
  * Support: It is essential to request guarantees, ensure that this service is agile in its responses and consult with customers who have had to request it.

It is advisable to ask the provider for detailed information and the necessary guarantees to ensure a fast and smooth migration, committing it contractually to adapt its solution both to new regulatory changes and possible attacks on computing.

Planning and implementing a cloud adoption strategy so that employees become familiar with the new application and use it regularly will allow for an effective experience, which is key to any cloud solution implementation process.
