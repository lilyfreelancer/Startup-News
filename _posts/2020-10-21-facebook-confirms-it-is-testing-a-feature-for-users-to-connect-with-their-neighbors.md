Surely you all already know NextDoor, the social network that communicates neighbors with each other, allowing them to offer services, do favors and keep informed about the current events in the neighborhood. It is a network in constant growth, and Facebook likes the idea so much that it wants to copy it.

Facebook confirmed this week that it is testing a new feature that encourages users to post and share news on miniature social networks focused on small geographic areas. We will be able to create special profiles that share limited information with neighbors, and Facebook will use the location data to post "more relevant" ads.

This feature is called Neighborhoods, and is currently only being tested in Calgary, Canada.

Matt Navarra shared screenshots of the Neighborhoods feature on [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/), and Jane Manchun Wong discovered an earlier version of the feature in May. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the test to Bloomberg and said:

More than ever, people are using Facebook to participate in their local communities. To help make it easier to do this, we are implementing a limited trial of Neighborhoods, a dedicated space within Facebook for people to connect with their neighbors.

The Facebook feature encourages users to connect with their neighbors. Once the button is pressed, we will have to confirm the location to match our area and then create a limited profile that can be seen by those nearby, even if they are not Facebook friends.

It will be based on 5 pillars: "be inclusive", "be friendly", "keep it local", "keep it clean" and "share valuable information". Users can invite friends to join and are asked to answer questions about their neighborhood and share pictures.

Although the test is very local at the moment, it will surely be expanded worldwide in the near future.
