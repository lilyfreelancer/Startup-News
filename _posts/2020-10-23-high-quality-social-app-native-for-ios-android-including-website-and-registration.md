drolo - drop it or love it is a fully developed app (native for iOS & Android) that allows users to get feedback on posted photos within 30 seconds. This approach is new and unique.

"How is my dress?" "How do I look in the cap?" When a photo is posted, it often takes a long time to get reactions from other users. This is annoying, because everyone wants to know immediately how other people like the photo.

At drolo, all users who are currently online in the app can vote live on the photos posted by other users with Drop or Love. After only 30 seconds you get a percentage value and can see at a glance how well the photo was rated.

As additional functions there is "this or that", where two photos can be compared and "POW" picture of the week. POW is an online photo contest, where  
within a certain period of time all posted photos can participate and be evaluated in parallel. The winner is the one who has received the highest percentage value for his or her picture.

drolo has about 10.000 downloads and is rated with 4,4 stars at Google Play or 5 stars in the App Store.
