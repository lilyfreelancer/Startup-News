[Global Robot Expo 2020](https://www.globalrobotexpo.com/ "Global Robot Expo 2020") will take place on October 20th and 21st in a totally disruptive, virtual and immersive environment, with the purpose of continuing to configure a unique, high-level and interactive networking ecosystem, but safeguarding security measures from the strictest point of view, as confirmed this Monday in a note.

The 2020 edition of the leading fair in industry, robotics and innovation, already considered a crucial tool for business development in the sector, will not be postponed any longer and comes in a 100% virtual version in which visitors will have their own avatar to visit exhibitors, be in the most advanced technology or Industry 4.0 conferences and establish relationships with corporate CEOs or important decision makers.

The essence of the fair, as explained by its organizers, will remain the same, "a meeting point with the main national and international players, full of novelties, high-level experts and a perfect and immersive place to connect with suppliers, distributors and potential customers".

In this line, Enric Forner Clavijo, CEO - Founder of GR-EX 2020 assures that "going from a 100% traditional fair to the organization and coordination of a totally virtual and immersive event means, precisely, continuing to transfer our passion for innovation and technology", while he comments that "this allows us to maintain the essence of this international congress that now more than ever opens a door to the Industry 4.0 without borders, deploying the range of networking in an exponential way".

With the intention of continuing to promote the DNA of GR-EX, it will continue to have four well-defined areas:

  * Industry: an international showcase on industrial innovation, automation and digital transformation.
  * Logistics: the brand experience personified by conferences, live demonstrations and an exhibition area for innovation in logistics and intralogistics.
  * Robotics: a space already traditional in all our editions where, together, we will shape the future of robotics and intelligent systems.
  * Artificial Intelligence: a new area dedicated to existing solutions in Artificial Intelligence, aimed at the digital transformation of companies and industries.

Additionally, during the two days of the fair you will be able to attend AirMob Expo, a fair dedicated to innovation within the theme of Smart Mobility.

This multidisciplinary meeting aims to share the experiences of land mobility achieved in SMART CITY by autonomous vehicles and new trends in SMART MOBILITY in urban and interurban areas, which can now be extrapolated to the 3rd dimension through the use of electric personal aircraft for vertical takeoff (eVTOL). The trend in this sector is the development of new ground and air devices that are more ecological, sustainable, safe and accessible to everyone.
