According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/lunchbox-series-a/):

> With many restaurants forced to rely entirely on the delivery and takeout business during the pandemic, there’s been a lot of discussion about whether the industry can survive while paying hefty fees to delivery platforms like Uber Eats and Grubhub.
> 
> Lunchbox, on the other hand, is a startup that allows restaurants to build ordering experiences on their own websites and apps. Today, it’s announcing that it has raised $20 million in Series A funding.
> 
> CEO Nabeel Alamgir knows the industry well, having served as Bareburger’s CMO — a position he rose to after starting out as a busboy at the New York City chain’s first location. He told me that he isn’t expecting restaurants to abandon third-party delivery platforms. But if they can handle more online orders themselves, they’ll make more money while also maintaining a direct relationship with their most loyal customers, for example by offering them personalized promotions.

> “You don’t want to lose a customer to these marketplaces,” Alamgir said. “You should be on these channels, but you should also invite your customers to order from you directly.”
