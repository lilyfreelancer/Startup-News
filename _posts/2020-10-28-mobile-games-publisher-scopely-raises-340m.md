According to [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/28/scopely-raises-340-million-at-3-3-billion-valuationas-mobile-games-thrive-during-pandemic/):

> Scopely, the publisher of games like Star Trek: Fleet Command and Marvel Strike Force, has raised $340 million to continue its mobile gaming growth plans as players embrace games during the pandemic.
> 
> The deal values Scopely at $3.3 billion (according to a source close to the matter), post-money, and it gives the company a war chest so that it can continue to make big acquisitions like the purchase of FoxNext Games last January from Disney. It also shows that some big, experienced investors are willing to double down on games as they become a giant industry in the midst of [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/).
> 
> The fifth round of funding comes from Wellington Management, NewView Capital, TSG Consumer Partners, CPP Investments, funds managed by BlackRock, D1, Battery Ventures, Eldridge, Declaration Partners, and Moore Strategic Ventures. Additional investors in the round include Greycroft, Baillie Gifford, Sands Capital, Revolution Growth, and Highland Capital Partners.
