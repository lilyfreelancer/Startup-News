[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) has raised a replacement $37.5 million investment led by NEA, ]representing a vote of confidence by the longtime risk capital firm within the Seattle startup’s software development tools for programming the underlying infrastructure of the cloud.

The 35-person startup, founded in 2017 by former Microsoft engineering leaders Joe Duffy and Eric Rudder, has developed “one of the foremost significant and impressive approaches to redefining how the cloud is employed that we’ve seen in years, very similar to OS revolutions of the past,” said Scott Sandell, NEA’s managing general partner, during a statement Wednesday morning announcing the investment.

Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group and Tola Capital, which led Pulumi’s $15 million Series A funding round two years ago, also participated within the new Series B funding round.

NEA, formally referred to as New Enterprise Associates, was founded in 1977 and has offices in areas including Silicon Valley , Boston, ny and Maryland. It closed on a $3.6 billion fund in March, bringing the entire capital raised over its lifetime to just about $24 billion. Its portfolio includes other cloud infrastructure like Cloudflare, also as an array of startups in areas including healthcare and robotics.

The investment brings Pulumi’s total funding raised to $57.5 million. With the round, NEA partner Aaron Jacobson is joining the Pulumi board of directors, alongside existing board members S. Somasegar, director of Madrona Venture Group, and Sheila Gulati, director of Tola Capital.
