According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-28/whoop-valued-at-1-2-billion-with-ivp-softbank-manning-backing):

> Whoop, the maker of a wearable device that tracks sleep among other health metrics, is valued at $1.2 billion after raising $100 million from investors including venture capital firm IVP, SoftBank Vision Fund and athletes including Eli Manning, Larry Fitzgerald and Patrick Mahomes.
> 
> “Consumer demand is growing as people become more interested in taking health into their own hands,” Whoop founder and Chief Executive Officer Will Ahmed said in an interview. The Boston-based company will spend the newly raised capital on developing technology and accelerating growth by bolstering marketing in countries to which it already ships such as Australia, France, Germany and Spain, he said. Funds will also be used to bolster a recruiting effort that has already seen the company add more than 200 new staff this year, taking its headcount to over 325.
