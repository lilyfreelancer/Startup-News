Healthtech gamification platform Sidekick Health has scored $20 million in funding led by Wellington Partners and Asabys Partners. This series A round of funding will hopefully expand their services to other markets where the pandemic is still going strong.

They operate under a b2b2c model, meaning they partner up with healthcare companies to provide their gamified health score application.
