The Spanish marketplace-type platform, [Encantado de Comerte](https://encantadodecomerte.es/), is dedicated to the use of food with a solidarity and social project. This free access tool for all types of users to food "is not just a company. It is a way of life that seeks to raise awareness and promote change towards a better world: more just, more ethical and more sustainable" says Gabriel Ramas, co-founder of Encantado de Comerte.

30% of the food produced in the world ends up in the garbage, producing a great disadvantage for the environment and for society. Thus, products that have not yet expired or could not be sold in many stores end up in landfills. The founders of this idea "observed that huge amounts of food in perfect condition were thrown away in the entire system of final consumption," says Ramas. As a result, "they considered correcting this problem" he stresses.

This App is the innovative alternative that provides a solution not only to food waste, but also facilitates access to vulnerable families dedicated to the use of food. It is also convenient, anonymous and avoids the stigmatization that comes with going to soup kitchens or aid centers for this group.
