It is just over a year old. In the last few days it achieved an investment round of 500,000 euros. It is Valencian, like its founder, who is 23 years old. It has more than 12,000 clients and is currently valued at around three million euros. Francisco Villalba Segarra must have done something right with Internxt to have these figures. Specifically, he has rethought cloud storage in favor of the user. Almost nothing.

The maximum asset of this new Dropbox is the security and privacy of the client through the encryption of the documents. So is the planet. "The Internet has become a site owned by four large corporations that abuse their power, and many times violate the user's privacy," says Villalba Segarra, CEO of the Spanish startup.

The Valencian, who at the age of 12 was already starting out in cyberspace, wants his main product, Internxt Drive, to be the first cloud that users "can really trust". His idea solves the security and privacy problems affecting both individuals and companies, and which none of us are unaware of these days.

The tool fragments and encrypts the files that consumers upload to the cloud so that only they have access to them. All thanks to a network of providers who are responsible for storing encrypted documents, says Villalba Segarra. The levantino is part of the T500 list of The Next Web with the 500 most influential young people in the technological field. In 2018 he was nominated for the Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe.

In addition, the startup has a commitment, not only with the digital property of the user, but also with the planet. For every new customer, the company will plant a tree. The CEO of Internxt expects to "close 2020 with about 20,000 active users on Internxt Drive". He also expects to reach several million rounds in a couple of years and capture large companies. We will see. For the time being, he is following his way, well advised, in the Shuttle accelerator.
