[According to investigators](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/former-microsoft-software-engineer-sentenced-nine-years-prison-stealing-more-10-million), during his time at Microsoft, he stole a large number of coupon cards and codes that could be redeemed online for Microsoft products and games. He resold the codes on the Internet at a profit, earning millions.

The former Microsoft employee used the money he had swindled to buy a $160,000 Tesla and a villa with a lake view.

The former Microsoft employee bought a 160,000 dollar Tesla and a villa with a view of the lake from the money he had swindled.

His criminal machinations earned the Microsoft employee a fortune, which he invested in a $160,000 Tesla and a 1.7 million villa with a lake view.

### Suspicion directed at other employees

The young man had disguised his activities in the Microsoft network in such a way that it looked as if other employees had stolen the voucher codes. It took until mid-2018 for his employer to catch him out. He was fired, and the US judiciary initiated an investigation. Volodymyr K. was accused of tax fraud, money laundering and fraud.

> Stealing from your employer is bad enough, but stealing and then making it look like your colleagues are the guilty ones makes the damage go beyond dollars and cents.

The trial has now ended with a sentence of nine years in prison and $8.3 million in damages. Prosecutor Brian Moran said: "Stealing from your employer is bad enough, but stealing and then making it look like your colleagues are the guilty ones makes the damages exceed dollars and cents. After serving his sentence, the Ukrainian is threatened with deportation.
