According to the latest report by [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/python-creator-guido-van-rossum-joins-microsoft/), Guido van Rossum has come out of retirement to work for Microsoft.

This comes at a time when Python has just passed Java in popularity and become second behind C. Proof both of the maturity of the Python language in the industry and of the rise of uses for which it excels (notably machine learning).

Stack Overflow, which ranked it, after a survey of its users in 2020, 3áµ‰ "most popular language" and 1st "most desired".
