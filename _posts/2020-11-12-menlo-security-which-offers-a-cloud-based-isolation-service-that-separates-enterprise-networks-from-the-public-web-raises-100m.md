Menlo Security, a cloud security company based in Mountain View, California, has raised $100 million in Series E funding, pushing the new company value towards the $800 million mark.

This round of fundraising was led by Vista Equity Partners with participation from Neuberger Berman, General Catalyst, JP Morgan, among others.

The company intends to use the funds to accelerate market expansion and expand go-to-market capabilities, as well as to increase engineering investments to accelerate product delivery and category expansion.

Led by CEO Amir Ben Efraim, Menlo Security provides enterprises with a SaaS security platform to prevent malicious attacks; secure uninterrupted work while accessing the Internet, SaaS, or private applications; and remove the operational burden from security operations teams.

Customers include seven of the top ten banks, four of the top five credit card issuers, and some of the world's largest energy and critical infrastructure companies.
