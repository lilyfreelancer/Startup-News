Corporate America is pushing their internet marketing game further than ever, and according to a report by [Digiday](https://digiday.com/marketing/retailers-are-pushing-their-employees-to-become-tiktok-influencers/), even low level employees are being involved with influencer marketing.

As one example preseneted within the article:

> Last week, GameStop encouraged store workers to submit videos of themselves — at work — dancing to the #RedWineChallenge. The winning group would get gift cards plus access to more work hours during Black Friday. The company took down the offer after workers criticized the callousness of pinning more hours to a dance challenge, but GameStop isn’t alone in its eagerness to push its workers to become active TikTokers. An increasing number of retailers see employee TikToks as the future of their marketing strategies.

And Sephora is certainly taking advantage within their chains:

> Sephora has a pre-approved group of employee influencers who are active on TikTok, which Vox called the “Sephora Squad.” One Wendy’s employee, Ricky Federici, has built up 70,000 followers thanks to his Baconator tutorials. And over the summer, Dunkin’ launched its Crew Ambassadors program, an employee influencer network that so far includes a group of four Dunkin’ baristas and retail workers who already had sizable TikTok followings.
