Cato Networks, the provider of the world's first SASE-based platform, announced its largest capital effort of $130M in a Series E round of funding...

It was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation of a new investor, Coatue, and existing investors, Greylock, Aspect Ventures, among others. The company is valued around $1 billion due to the current demand for Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) applications.

> "SASE is the hottest area in IT, and this funding round further attests to Cato's leadership of the SASE market," says Shlomo Kramer, CEO and co-founder of Cato Networks. "Only the Cato Cloud was built from the ground up as a converged and cloud-based global SASE service."
