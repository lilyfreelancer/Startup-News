EdgeQ is a startup developing 5G systems-on-chip, and they recently came out of the woodwork with a whopping $51 million in funding. The company says the fresh capital will expand their go-to-market efforts and improve mass production of 5G chips. This is expected to help the **'[AI](https://new.blicio.us/why-artificial-intelligence-is-still-not-that-intelligent/) at the edge'** effort currently buzzing on in Silicon Valley.

## What is Edge Computing?

Today, we live in a totally digitalized era in which most devices generate and share data on a large scale, whether it is a smartphone or an intelligent refrigerator.

This process involves the IoT (Internet of things) which refers to the ability of objects to transfer data over the Internet. In all of them, Artificial Intelligence and data analysis are present so that information can be processed and distributed in a more organized way.

However, there is a limitation on this issue and is that the collection of data does not mean proper treatment, ie, IoT solutions host data but often do not know what to do with them.

In this sense, Edge Computing has emerged, a computing paradigm for IoT environments that processes and stores information from sensors or IoT devices locally, that is, as close as possible to the end devices and data generating sensors.

Edge means edge, so applied to this scenario, we would say that data processing is not done centrally in the cloud or Cloud, but in a decentralized way at the edge of the network.

On the other hand, Edge Computing offers the possibility of using servers capable of analyzing mass data from intelligent factories, supply networks or transport systems without waiting time, that is, in real time, an aspect that allows immediate decision making.
