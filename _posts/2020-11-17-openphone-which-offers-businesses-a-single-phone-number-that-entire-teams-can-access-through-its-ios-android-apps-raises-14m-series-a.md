OpenPhone raised $14M in their Series A led by Craft Ventures, with assisting participation from Y Combinator and Slow Ventures. This is the follow up from the $2 million they had received in seed funding.

The company makes it easy to have a business phone number accross all of your company's devices. It works for all mobile operating systems, as well via desktop through a web interface.

> "What happens to the office phone when offices go remote? Expensive business phones are no longer needed,” said David Sacks, co-founder of Craft Ventures. “Nobody is there to pick them up anymore. Virtual offices need virtual business phones. When making investments like this, we look for clear bottom-up adoption among users and we saw it immediately with OpenPhone.”

> “Their timing is perfect,” said Sacks. “They have figured out what people want in a modern phone app and are delivering it.”
