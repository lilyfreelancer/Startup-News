Lovers of retro products are in luck because Nokia intends to launch its Nokia 6300 and 8000, two models that remind us of the old devices of the Finnish brand, but with a slight change of image and at more than competitive prices.

The models remain faithful to the original Nokia, with narrow screens and physical keyboard instead of touch, as are the current smartphones.

The operating system, KaiOS, allows the installation of the most used communication applications such as Whatsapp, Facebook or [Twitter](https://new.blicio.us/how-to-promote-your-startup-using-twitter/) and some from Google, for example Google Maps, Youtube or Google Search, among others.

With regard to its technical characteristics are far from the capabilities that have the current devices, since the RAM is only 512MB and the internal capacity of both models is 4 Gb. The processor they have mounted is a Snapdragon 205 and the removable battery is 1,500 mAh.

Obviously, it should be noted that these models are not aimed at those who use their smartphones for games, watching movies or other more multimedia-oriented uses. However, those who want a phone to call and send messages -there are more and more users who only use these functions- the new vintages models from Nokia are ideal.

The prices couldn't be more accessible since the Nokia 6300 4G is over 49 euros, while the Nokia 8000 4G reaches 79 euros.
