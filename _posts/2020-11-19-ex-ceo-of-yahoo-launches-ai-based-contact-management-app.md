Sunshine, Marissa Mayer's startup, debuts with the launch of an [AI](https://new.blicio.us/why-artificial-intelligence-is-still-not-that-intelligent/)-based app that promises to change the way you manage your contacts.

A startup that was born in 2018, in collaboration with Enrique Mu√±oz Torres, after his departure from Yahoo! and now makes the launch of his first product official.

This application for iOS, called Sunshine Contacts, uses artificial intelligence to manage user contacts in the background. A dynamic that promises to save time by solving typical problems when organizing contacts, such as duplicates, outdated or incomplete information, among other factors.

A dynamic that is based on the information of contacts and addresses in Gmail and in the app Contacts in iOS. So you'll have a complete contact book, with all your contacts organized in one place and all the information you need from each of them... phone numbers, email addresses, LinkedIn profiles, etc.

On the other hand, it also allows us to share contact information with other users and allows them to have our data updated. A dynamic that will work between users with Sunshine Contacts.

It also has some additional functions, for example, when it detects that you want to communicate with a certain contact, it will show you relevant content so that you have context for your interaction. And it can use location to facilitate the exchange of information.

Sunshine Contacts can be downloaded for free from the App Store, but only for invited users. Just leave your phone number at this link and wait for the Sunshine team to send you the invitation.
