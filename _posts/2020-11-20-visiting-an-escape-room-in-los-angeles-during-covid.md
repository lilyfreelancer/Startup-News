With [escape rooms in Los Angeles](https://la.mazerooms.com/escape-rooms-los-angeles/) finally open again after closing during the [COVID-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/) pandemic, you may be wondering what precautions are being taken and if visiting an escape room is safe.

Because of the limited interaction with people, escape rooms are technically safer than dining out at a restaurant, going to a movie or a sporting event. But in these ever-changing times, it's still a good idea to make sure you are safe. Here are some tips if you are planning on visiting an escape room.

## Call and ask questions

Before you book an escape room, call the location and ask about their COVID-19 precautionary plan. Many escape room locations have implemented disinfecting plans, as well as social distancing, required masks, and limited groups.

These steps will greatly improve the safety of the location, so it's important to make sure your location is compliant.

Find out if the company is limiting group sizes. Most escape room locations are prohibiting mixing two groups together so you'll be able to experience the mystery with just those in your immediate group. This cuts down on the contact with people and also allows you to do more of the work yourself â€” making for a better and safer overall experience. In addition, ask the escape room employee how often rooms are being cleaned, if they are switching out items, disinfecting regularly and if masks are required. You don't want to show up unprepared.

## Find out if there's a virtual option

Although escape rooms are about the physical experience, many companies are offering guests a virtual experience where they can navigate escape rooms without risking their health. These digital format rooms differ from location to location, with some having employees perform the tasks while participants instruct them what to do.

Others decided to opt for a more strategic method, making the experience more about solving the puzzle than the physical interaction. Guests can still work together virtually, talking over clues, leads, ideas and more. This method is great for those who aren't comfortable leaving their homes. Also, online escape room costs are considerably cheaper than the in-person experience. Although there are limitations to a virtual escape room, the idea and concept are still there, making this a great option for anyone looking for a good puzzle or mystery.
