While the coronavirus had devastated startups every corner of the world, the Middle East surprisingly has a blostering startup scene.

According to a report from MAGNiTT, $704m was invested across 564 projects in this sector of the globe, which had been non-existant in the past.

One of the region's bigges purchases was Careem, which was bought by Uber for $3.1 billion to compete for cab services in this competitive region.
