The technology giant [Apple](https://new.blicio.us/the-humble-beginnings-of-apple/) will have to pay a 10 million euro fine for misleading advertising with its iPhone, selling it as waterproof but not clarifying the limits that such resistance could have.

The Italian Competition and Market Authority (AGCM) considers that Apple has incurred in "incorrect commercial practices" by using "promotional messages about the water resistance of various iPhone models, but without establishing that this water resistance can only occur under certain conditions. 

The models referred to by this body are the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, XR, XS, XS Max, 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. According to Apple, these devices can be underwater for up to 30 minutes at a depth of between one and four months. But the body considers that this resistance has only been tested in static and pure water, so it is not entirely safe to use and waterproof in all other conditions.

It would then be excluded from such water resistance when the iPhone is introduced into the sea or falls into dirty or flowing water, as it may damage the device. 

Also, the Italian agency has reported that the warranty of iPhones does not cover the data caused by liquids, so users who experience failures or problems because their iPhone has fallen into a liquid will not have the corresponding technical assistance. 

Apple will therefore have to pay this figure of 10 million euros, although it will have a period of 60 days to file an appeal.
