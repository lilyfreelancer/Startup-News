Neuromobile is a pioneering big data company from Murcia, Spain. Sinc in the use of big data applied to the knowledge and prediction of customer behavior in large shopping malls, launches a functionality "previous appointment" aimed at children to have their interviews with Santa Claus and the Three Kings this holiday season.

In general, the startup offers a new appointment management service available in the application and compatible with any useful online platform to make appointments in a practical, simple and intuitive way for both the applicant and the recipient of the call, and create a unique experience for the end customer.

In this way, a statement explains, the company offers a premium service that provides peace of mind and security by being able to book a personal visit or attend a physical event and "in the event that we are forced as organizers to cancel the event due to a major cause or due to strict confinement, we can keep the appointments and have a unique experience with the user through a video conference service," says Raúl García Serapio, founder and CEO of Neuromobile.

The service is already available in 27 shopping centers (Vialia, Miramar, H2o, Espacio Mediterráneo and, soon, Xanadú).

It also generates personalized confirmation messages and reminders with the information of the meeting, as well as possible cancellations (or changes in the appointment). The integration of the functionality can be done in the Neuromobile or third party app in an easy, fast and simple way.
