South Summit, the global platform for innovation and high-value connections among key players in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, has just opened the registration period for its Startup Competition.

The projects that want to participate in South Summit 2021 and be among the 100 most innovative startups in the world can be submitted through the website of the meeting: <https://www.southsummit.co/en/register>. The registration process will be open until the end of April.

The 100 selected startups will have the opportunity to participate in the next edition of South Summit 2021, to be held from October 5th to 7th, 2021, with many new features based on the learning and success of previous editions.

A Selection Committee appointed by Spain Startup-South Summit, which includes prominent actors in the ecosystem, will select the startups for the 2021 edition based on criteria such as innovation, technical and commercial feasibility, scalability, ie its potential for internationalization and application in other countries, its team and interest for potential investors.

During the celebration of the South Summit, the finalist startups will pitch their proposal to top-level international investors, as well as achieve visibility and access to corporations in search of innovation.

They will also have the opportunity to close 'one on one' meetings with the most important actors of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, as well as matchmaking with investors and large corporations through South Summit's digital platform.

Finally, a jury formed by investors, partners and experts of the ecosystem will be in charge of choosing the best projects of each sector present at the meeting and the four great awards of South Summit 2021: best team, most scalable startup, most innovative and the global winner.
