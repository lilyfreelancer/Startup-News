A good security system for one’s home or business is a no brainer to prevent theft and property damage.

Since the [Covid-19](https://new.blicio.us/low-cost-online-business-ideas-for-the-post-covid-19-world/) pandemic had started, theft-related anxiety is through the roof due to the economic downturn, and thus a heightened risk of theft. And in general, thieves prefer easy tagets with poor security and having valuable possessions in plain sight.

Therefore, the best prevention is to have a good security system so that we are not caught off guard.

## Keeping Up with Security Trends & Technology

It is true that theft methods have evolved, but so have, at the same time, the technologies and devices that stop intruders. Security systems are currently designed so that if one of the elements that make up the system fails, another element is active in order to detect any anomaly and protect the facilities.

There are many cases of robbery in homes and businesses, and in several cases the physical integrity of people has been attacked, but thanks to the cameras and sensors installed at different points, it has been possible to catch the assailants. In some cases, it has been possible to catch the assailants in time, before they could enter to steal and damage the buildings, thanks to the security system installed.

To begin with, all the companies, stores and properties on the estate must have an anti-intrusion security system connected to an alarm reception center, so that when an alarm is triggered, the center can alert the surveillance patrol and access the site of the incident.

The company's security systems must be inhibitor-proof, since it is a device widely used by thieves to disable the alarm system. These systems must be equipped with the necessary elements to detect any intrusion sufficiently in advance to be able to warn the alarm center. It is vital to complement the anti-intrusion system with security cameras, to prevent and to give information of the facts in the case that the robbery has taken place.

### Smart Home Security

The latest trend for home security is having everything consolidated into a mobile application, which is managed by both homeowners and security companies simultaneously. Not only does this apply to internet-connected security cameras, but also lights, locks, thermostats and garage doors are also manageable through such apps.

Security cameras must be able to be seen in real-time, so that the operational center of the security company can monitor the facilities giving support to the surveillance patrol. On one side of the surveillance body, it is possible to see what is happening in real-time online, thanks to the App provided by the security company.

And what’s even more important than is having you a local security system provider in your local area rather than outsourcing to a random support center outside of your home state (or country). For example, the [San Antonio home security](https://alamosecure.com/best-home-security-san-antonio/) company Alamo Smart Home offers support for local residents with employees that are a part of the local community.

In this way, it is possible for the end-user to visualize all the installations in real time, while also being monitored by local professionals for assured home security.
