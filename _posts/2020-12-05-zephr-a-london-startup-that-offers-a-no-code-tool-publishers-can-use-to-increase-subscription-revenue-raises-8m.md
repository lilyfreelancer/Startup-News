Zephr, a technology platform that assists media companies in increasing their subscription income, has closed an eight million dollar round, led by Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments (BDMI), and with the participation of already present investors such as venture capital firms Nauta Capital and Knight Capital.

Additional funding was received via Silicon Valley Bank UK Branch (SVB), bringing the total capital raised since 2019 to $11 million (9.1 million euros).

The global pandemic has accelerated changes in traditional media revenue sources, with consumers increasingly consuming digital content. Some of the clients of this start up are McClatch, News Corp Australia, Dennis Publishing and PEI Media.

Nauta Capital is a venture capital firm based in Barcelona, London and Munich. The company, which has a team of 24 professionals, has more than 500 million euros of assets under management in its portfolio.
