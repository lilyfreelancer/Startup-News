With the recent shutdowns around the country, everyone’s looking for new ways to stay active and healthy. It’s the perfect time to gear up and have an adventure.

Hiking, hunting, camping, and fishing are great ways to safely get active, breath some fresh air, and stay in shape this year. As long as you stock up on the [best bait and gear](https://www.kittlesoutdoor.com/) and have a plan, you’ll have an awesome trip.

But before you hit the trails, you have to make sure you’re ready. Here’s a quick guide to getting outside in 2020. 

## Step 1: Get prepared

If you ask any outdoors expert, the first thing they’ll tell you is that you have to plan for the worst and hope for the best. 

Backpacking and camping can be dangerous, even if you’re in a maintained park. It’s important to make a plan and be as prepared as possible. Plan out your hiking trails, campsite, meals, and schedule, so you’re prepared to handle anything nature throws at you! 

To put it simply, it’s always better to be overprepared than underprepared. 

## Step 2: Have the best gear

Whether you’re hunting, fishing, or just camping, you want to have top-quality gear to help you out. 

Head to a [Colusa sporting goods store](https://www.kittlesoutdoor.com/) to pack up for your trip. That’s where you can get advice on the best brands and models, from jackets to fishing poles. Whatever you’re taking with you, make sure it’s built to withstand anything. 

## Step 3: Stay flexible

It’s important to make a plan and be prepared before you go on your trip — but things won’t always work out as planned! 

Rainy nights, animals, busy trails… there are all kinds of unpredictable elements that can change your plans. As long as you’re prepared and have the best quality gear to keep you safe, you’ll have nothing to worry about. So enjoy the journey and stay flexible.
