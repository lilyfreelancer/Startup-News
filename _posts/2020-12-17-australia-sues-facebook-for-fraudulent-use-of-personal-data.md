Facebook is once again facing another lawsuit. This time it has been the Australian authorities who have sued the social network and two other subsidiaries for using and collecting user data in a misleading way.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been in charge of this lawsuit against the technology giant, seeking to have Facebook pay a fine although the amount is not yet known. They accuse the social network of having collected and commercially used the personal information of users through the Onavo Protect app, especially between 2006 and 2007.

According to the commission, Onavo Protect, which closed its doors months ago, was a virtual private network or VPN as it is known, which allowed secure and private navigation on the Internet but also collected data from users that was later used in other applications. 

This information was used by Facebook for its marketing and advertising campaigns.

The president of the commission, Rod Sims, has indicated that the app collected this data that was sent directly to Facebook.

The intention of the commission is that Facebook will pay a fine, probably quite substantial, although the amount has not yet been published.

For its part, the company led by Mark Zuckerberg has denied the commission's accusations, stating that the app was transparent in reporting on how personal data was collected and used.

This is not the first time that the commission has sued major technology companies. In fact, in July, it turned against Google for alleged fraudulent practices by combining users' personal information with activities on other third-party portals without their knowledge or express consent.
