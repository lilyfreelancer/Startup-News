Amazon has joined the trend of group video calls and does so through Alexa, which has just incorporated this functionality and will allow seven people to connect using the digital assistant of the ecommerce giant.

The company thus expands the service that Alexa already offered for video calls but which were restricted to only two participants, increasing the number of participants in these video calls.

Its use is very simple, just create a group in the Alexa app and give it a name. Once this gesture has been made, all you have to do is start the group chat with the audio command "Alexa, call" and the name of the group that has been set up for that group. This can be done with the Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Show or Fire TV Cube.

Therefore, Amazon is getting on the videoconference bandwagon as a communication system that is being set up in recent times due to the coronavirus crisis, not only because of the fact that they have to telework, but also because of the distance they have to keep from family and friends that can be reduced thanks to these virtual online group meetings.
