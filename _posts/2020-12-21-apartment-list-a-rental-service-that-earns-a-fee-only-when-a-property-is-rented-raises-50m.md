With the the post-pandemic world devastating both renters and landlords alike, Apartment List is an aspiring startup looking to take take away initial fees normally found on real-estate platforms.

According to a [Bloomberg report](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/12/21/sf-based-apartment-list-scores-50-million-doub.html?page=all):

> The Series D funding round was led by Janus Henderson Investors, a London-based global asset management group, with participation from Allen & Co., Canaan Partners, Tenaya Capital and Quantum Partners LP, a fund managed by Soros Fund Management LLC.
> 
> Founded in 2011 by John Kobs and Chris Erickson at TechCrunch Disrupt, San Francisco-based Apartment List makes money by tracking users who come to its website to view landlord rental postings. If users move into a listing they find, the landlord pays Apartment List for the lead on a new tenant. Kobs, now CEO, said he and Erickson created the company after having negative experiences as both renters and landlords.
