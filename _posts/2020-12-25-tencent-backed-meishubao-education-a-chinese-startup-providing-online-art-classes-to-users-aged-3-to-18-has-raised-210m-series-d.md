Meishubao Education is a Tencent-related Chinese firm that offers a highly popular educational art software suite. The company disclosed on Thursday the completion of a Series D round of financing at $210 million led by US-based private equity (PE) firm TPG’s global impact investing platform The Rise Fund.

According to a quote published on [Deal street Asia](https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/tpg-series-d-meishubao-221403/):

> “Inclusive education is one of the key areas of The Rise Fund’s social impact investment, and interactive education is an integral part of getting closer to that objective,” said Sun Chang, managing partner of TPG China, in the statement.
> 
> The company “leverages technologies to effectively expand the breadth and depth of art education,” said Sun.
> 
> “This model not only provides more interactive education opportunities for children — including those in rural areas — but also builds a larger platform for art educators to demonstrate their value.”
