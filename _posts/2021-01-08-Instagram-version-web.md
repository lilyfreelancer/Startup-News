Instagram is testing a new way to present its Stories in the desktop version, in the form of a carousel instead of a mosaic, a functionality that only a certain group of users can access, as it is still in the testing phase.

The social network launched this new version of the Stories presentation to a small group that has been enjoying it for a month, as explained by Engadget.

The interesting thing about Instagram's new Stories presentation is that it is done in the form of a carousel so that users can click on a Story or simply let it play automatically, which means that it is easier to follow the Story within its sequence.

What is clear is that this new functionality, whose extension to a wider audience is not yet clear, can be welcomed by users, as it seems that the way the Stories were presented in the web version was not the most suitable formula for large screens.
