Members, a platform that helps physical businesses implement localized marketing campaigns, has raised $80 million in a Series D funding round led by JMI Equity.

The raise comes at a crucial time for businesses, as retailers across the spectrum have to quickly adopt e-commerce due to the pandemic. However, companies with local physical stores are far from extinct and will continue to exist in a post-pandemic world. By focusing on their "local" presence, including offering local pages (e.g., Facebook) and reviews (e.g., Google and Yelp), businesses can still attract customers from Amazon and their ilk. This is where Soci comes in.

Founded in 2012, San Diego-based Soci has hundreds of enterprise-scale customers, such as Hertz and Ace Hardware, who use the Soci platform to manage search, reviews and local content across their myriad individual business locations. It's all about ensuring that businesses maintain accurate and consistent location-specific information, which can be particularly challenging for companies with thousands of outlets.

"For businesses with multiple locations, the ability to connect with local audiences through the most influential marketing networks like Google, Yelp and Facebook was critical to keeping their local businesses afloat during the pandemic," Soci co-founder and CEO Afif Khoury told VentureBeat.

In addition, Soci offers analytics that can help determine which locations are performing best in terms of social reach and engagement, integrating with all the usual touch points where businesses typically connect with customers, such as Facebook, Yelp and Google.

"Soci now hosts and analyzes all of the most important marketing data from all major local marketing channels, such as search, social media, reviews and ads," continued Khoury.
