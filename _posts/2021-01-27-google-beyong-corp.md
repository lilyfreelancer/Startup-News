The technology giant Google has just announced a new technological suite of security solutions that will protect browser-based apps and cloud services. 

It is BeyondCorp Enterprise, which will replace BeyondCorp Remote Access, but will expand its capabilities with the aim of "protecting Google's applications, data and users", as Google said in a statement on its blog.

This new technological suit is aimed at organizations so that they can start their own journey towards Zero Trust, where the new functionality is based.

The Mountain View company has stated that over the years it has dedicated itself to "developing a solution for our customers that is cost-efficient and produces minimal disruption to existing deployments and business processes". 

This is based on criteria such as design, trust, reliability and scale.

According to Google, Beyond Enterprise offers three major advantages: it is a scalable and reliable Zero Trust platform with a secure, agentless architecture; it offers continuous, real-time, end-to-end protection; and it is an open, scalable solution that is compatible with a wide variety of complementary solutions.

During this time in which Google has been working, it has collaborated with companies around the world, such as VP of Engineering at Deliveroo, among others.
