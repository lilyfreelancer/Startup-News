A surprise change at Amazon. Jeff Bezos will step down as CEO of Amazon after 27 years in that position.

This does not mean that he will take another path, much less a retirement retirement, as he will continue to actively participate in Amazon as part of the board of directors. We tell you the details.

## Amazon will have a new CEO

Jeff Bezos announced the change of career path within Amazon in an email sent to his employees, which was published on the platform. And of course, it was also part of the news that was shared with its financial results.

This change will occur in the third quarter of 2021, where he will move on to serve as executive chairman of the board.

> In the position of executive chairman, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives [...] . I've never had more energy and it's not about retiring. I am passionate about the impact I believe these organizations can have.

After reviewing the history and evolution of Amazon since its inception in 1994, Jeff Bezos mentions that being CEO of Amazon is a big responsibility that consumes time that he cannot devote to other projects and initiatives. And of course, much less when it comes to personal projects.

For example, he mentions Blue Origin, the aerospace transportation company he founded in 2000, and the Bezos Earth Fund, his foundation against climate change. So he believes this is the best time at Amazon to make this transition.

> Amazon could not be better positioned for the future. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics.

Who will replace Jeff Bezos at Amazon? Andy Jassy will be the new CEO of Amazon. Recall that Jassy joined Amazon in 1997 as head of marketing, and now serves as CEO of AWS. And on some occasions he has already been mentioned as Bezos' successor.

So in the near future we will see Jeff Bezos playing a new role at Amazon as CEO.
