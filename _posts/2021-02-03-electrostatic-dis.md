With Covid-19 disrupting businesses around the world, there's a huge demand for improvement in the world of disinfection technology. In particular, indoor venues that normally attract crowds of people need a means to efficiently disinfect a large area within short periods of time.

The use of air-assisted [electrostatic disinfection](https://biopureservice.com/bham) seems to be taking the lead over wipes, sprays, or intense UV ray disinfection. While spraying of liquid disinfectants is a widely used method for homes and indoor businesses, electrostatic disinfection goes much further in achieving effectiveness and speed in the elimination of pathogens.
 
## What does electrostatic disinfection consist of?

Electrostatic cleaning is based on the application of a chemical disinfectant on surfaces through a special spraying system capable of taking using electromagnetic force enhance it's ability to kill off Covid-19.

In general, surfaces have a neutral or negative charge, so by positively charging the disinfectant, it will be attracted to surfaces. The result is that the disinfectant is strongly attracted to the surface to which it is applied and adheres strongly to it.

At the same time, the disinfectant droplets repel each other, so that once a certain surface is covered, an enveloping effect occurs so that the droplets spread out in all directions until the object is completely covered. This means that electrostatic disinfection is a cleaning specifically directed towards the area to be disinfected and generates a uniform coverage capable of reaching everywhere, as well as an optimization in the use of the disinfectant

Notable advantages include:
- **Greater coverage area**: Due to the electrostatic attraction between surface and the solution, an envelope is generated that covers the entire object to be treated, regardless of the presence of hidden areas, fissures or difficult-to-reach angles that other types of cleaning overlook.
- **High disinfectant rate*: This system achieves an effectiveness rate of 99.98%. This means virtually total elimination of a broad spectrum of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi, or spores. This can be useful going beyond the Covid-19 pandemic.
- **Safety**: The materials used in electrostatic cleaning is typically biodegradable. In addition, using spray applications like this would eliminate the need for direct contact by the user, making it humand and pet-friendly.
- **Speed of deployment**: The spraying action of this cleaning mechanism makes it easier and faster to cover a large surface area within your establishment. 


### Why electrostatic spraying over regular disinfectant sprays?

When using a conventional sprayer, only a portion of the disinfectant sprayed reaches the target surface. This is because gravity exerts its effect on many of the sprayed droplets, so that they fall to the ground or move away from the object to be disinfected.

In many cases the objects to be cleaned have a certain complexity in their structure or nooks and crannies that are difficult to reach with any sprayer. Think of the lower areas of a table, especially where the surface meets the legs. These points remain undisinfected, which means that they become sources of infection from which pathogens continue to act.

On the other hand, as we have mentioned, when an electrostatic sprayer is used, the disinfectant droplets, being electrostatically charged, all reach the target surface with a force greater than gravity. And there, thanks to their enveloping effect, they reach any area that is difficult to access, any nook and cranny, so that no spot is spared from complete disinfection.

In short, an electrostatic disinfection sprayer is more efficient and more effective than other types of sprayers. This means that a safer and healthier environment is generated for people while still being time and cost effective.
