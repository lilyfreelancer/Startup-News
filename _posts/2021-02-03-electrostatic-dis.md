With Covid-19 disrupting businesses around the world, there's a huge demand for improvement in the world of disinfection technology. In particular, indoor venues or offices that normally attract crowds of people need a means to efficiently disinfect a large area within short periods of time.

The use of air-assisted [electrostatic disinfection](https://biopureservice.com/bham) seems to be taking the lead over wipes, sprays, or intense UV ray disinfection. While spraying of liquid disinfectants is a widely used method for homes and indoor businesses, electrostatic disinfection goes much further in achieving effectiveness and speed in the elimination of pathogens.
 
## What does electrostatic disinfection consist of?

Electrostatic cleaning is based on the application of a chemical disinfectant on surfaces through a special spraying system capable of taking using electromagnetic force enhance it's ability to kill off Covid-19.

The use of air-propelled electrostatic disinfection is really a simple way to cover a large surface area with a disinfectant solution. The machine sends a positive charged to the liquid medium that your using before it leaves the tip of the sprayer, and into the air.

In general, surfaces have a neutral or negative charge, so by positively charging the disinfectant, it will be attracted to surfaces. The result is that the disinfectant is strongly attracted to the surface to which it is applied and adheres strongly to it. This applies to walls, tables, floors, chairs, and just about anything found in a typical work area. Keep in mind, this method works better on objects that are not porous.

At the same time, the disinfectant droplets repel each other, so that once a certain surface is covered, an enveloping effect occurs so that the droplets spread out in all directions until the object is completely covered. This means that electrostatic disinfection is a cleaning specifically directed towards the area to be disinfected and generates a uniform coverage capable of reaching everywhere, as well as an optimization in the use of the disinfectant.

Notable advantages include:
- **Greater coverage area**: Due to the electrostatic attraction between surface and the solution, an envelope is generated that covers the entire object to be treated, regardless of the presence of hidden areas, fissures or difficult-to-reach angles that other cleaning methods may overlook.
- **High disinfectant rate**: This system achieves an effectiveness rate of around 99%. This means virtually total elimination of a broad spectrum of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, fungi, or spores. This can be useful going beyond the Covid-19 pandemic, and into the regular flu season.
- **Safety**: The materials used in electrostatic cleaning is typically biodegradable. In addition, using spray applications like this would eliminate the need for direct contact by the user, making it humand and pet-friendly. With that said, it shouldn’t be applied to runnning electronics within close distance, like computers or printers.
- **Speed of deployment**: The spraying action of this cleaning mechanism makes it easier and faster to cover a large surface area within your establishment. Expect around 30 to 45 minutes in a typical large office, which is much better than wiping everything down with commercial cleaners.

The frequency of disinfecting depends on the type of business your manage. Consumer venues like bars or gyms will have people rotating contantly, so you may be using it several times a day. This is where the speed of these spraying mechanisms can be an advantage.

In an office where people are mostly in the same spot most of the day may fare will with just one or two spraying sessions a day.

### Why electrostatic spraying over cheaper disinfectant spraying mechanisms?

When using a conventional sprayer, only a portion of the disinfectant sprayed reaches the target surface, and it is distributed in an uneven manner when doing so in a rush. This is because gravity exerts its effect on many of the sprayed droplets, so that they fall to the ground or move away from the object to be disinfected.

In many cases the objects to be cleaned have a certain complexity in their structure or nooks and crannies that are difficult to reach with any sprayer. Think of the lower areas of a table, especially where the surface meets the legs. These areas remain contaminated, which means that they become sources of infection from which pathogens continue to act. Now keep in mind that covid-19, along with some types of bacteria, can still be effective after hours or days if left uncleaned.

On the other hand, as we have mentioned, when an electrostatic sprayer is used, the disinfectant droplets, having an electrostatic charge, all reach the target surface with a force greater than gravity. And there, thanks to their enveloping effect, they reach any area that is difficult to access, any nook and cranny, so that no spot is spared from complete disinfection.

In short, an electrostatic disinfection sprayer is more efficient and more effective than other types of sprayers. This means that a safer and healthier environment is generated for people while still being time and cost effective.

### How long will a disinfection last?

It should be noted that electrostatic disinfection of any sort is not special in the sense that it creates a protective barrier to prevent contamination. It's used to clear the area of germs before introducing new people into a certain area, reducing the chance of infection from whomever was present prior.

Your safety plan should revolve around frequent planned disinfections, and taking note who goes in and out of your facilities to prevent unnecessary contamination in the first place. This is why a time efficient disinfection method is needed.

## Final Words

Whether you're selling food or a tech startup in a small office, electrostatic disinfection is highly recommended as the primary means to keep businesses free from Covid-19. Since this virus is much more contagious than your typical flu, you can’t afford to leave traces of the virus where workers or customers and infect themselves. This may be the technology you need to bring back your in-person workforce over working from home.
