Acordding to a recent [update via Jack Dorsey's official Twitter account](https://nitter.fdn.fr/jack/status/1357588751757627393#m), he is now running a full Bitcoin node from what appears to be his personal computer.

The **bitcoind** node can be ran from servers or personal computers of all sorts, this node is more about the symbolism than it is for actually helping the Bitcoin network.
