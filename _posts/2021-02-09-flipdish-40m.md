According to [Sifted EU](https://sifted.eu/articles/food-delivery-flipdish-e40m/):

> Restaurants and delivery platforms have something of a difficult relationship. Restaurants hate the platform’s commission fees, which can be as high as 30%, but love (and need) online orders — especially during lockdowns. 

> Luckily for them, giant food delivery platforms like Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats are not their only option.

> Enter Flipdish, an Irish startup which is today announcing a €40m funding round from global investment firm Tiger Global Management. 

> Flipdish, founded in Dublin in 2015, offers restaurants (and hotels and grocery stores) a white-label platform, enabling them to take online orders from their own websites and set up loyalty programmes for their customers. It works with a range of courier partners to fulfill deliveries, like Stuart, Ziticity and in one Irish town, drone delivery startup Manna Aero. Its commission fee is also much lower than that charged by delivery platforms, at 7% plus a 50p order fee. 

> And crucially, says Flipdish CEO and cofounder Conor McCarthy, his team has no plans to steal away restaurants’ customers from them.
