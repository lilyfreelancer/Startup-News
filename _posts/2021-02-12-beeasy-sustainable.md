The startup Beeasy is trying to bring its innovative dose to the logistics sector, which is in the midst of a paradigm shift. In less than ten years, first Amazon has arrived, expanding the market, and then the coronavirus. Confinement has marked an exponential boom in e-commerce in 2020, but it also brings problems. Beeasy is trying to deal with the sheer volume of orders to be handled, and the ecological burden that comes with it.

Founded with a team of logistics experts and specialized in cloud technology, the startup offers a delivery system with "non-polluting" means. A network of "bees" (bees; employees) that will receive the package at home and will act within a maximum radius of 500 meters. Beeasy's bet is to deliver within one hour. This is what they call "last yard" delivery, says Sergio Gim√©nez, CEO and founder. He assures that "you have to be close to the user" to offer them "the service they deserve".

His delivery drivers are guided by a heat map with a route optimization and management algorithm developed by the company. The aim is to narrow delivery ranges and reduce the concentration of parcel vehicles, thereby reducing pollution. By 2030, last-mile deliveries are expected to generate more than 25 million tons of CO2 emissions each year in major Spanish cities.

"We work to service our hives, which are the neighborhoods, from our neighborhoods and with people from the neighborhood," says Juan Manso, COO of Beeasy. In addition, the brand offers the customer the possibility of choosing the delivery schedule in the evening, another novelty. Between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., the user can choose from a time grid where the "green hour" is indicated to "track the order".

On the other hand, the social and sustainable concept of the startup is also transferred to the legal field. Beeasy will offer employment contracts from the outset, preventing its employees from having to become self-employed. One of its objectives is that employment also reaches groups at risk of social exclusion. For this reason, they also hope to expand their network of 'bees' to neighborhood associations and social entities.
