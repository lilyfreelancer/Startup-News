The Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade (ICEX) in collaboration with EaTable Adventures has recently published a report on the foodtech sector in Spain. The study highlights the varied number of agents involved in the agri-food value chain. From its production to food consumption, they apply cutting-edge technology (biotechnology, robotics, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence...) improving the sector.

Public institutions, business associations, technology centers, science parks, universities and of course startups (foodtechs) play an active role. Together they have developed an ecosystem that has turned Spain into a global food power: it accounts for 19% of our GDP and 17% of exports. Also incubators and accelerators, which according to ICEX play an essential role.

## Entrepreneurial impulse

Specifically, it values them as "fundamental levers for the development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the food sector in Spain". [In the report](https://www.foodswinesfromspain.com/spanishfoodwine/wcm/idc/groups/public/documents/documento_anexo/mdix/ody5/~edisp/dax2021869589.pdf) Foodtech in Spain: fuelling a more sustainable and efficient Food System, it highlights that innovation centers, incubators and accelerators drive the creation and growth of new food technology companies. It also highlights the progressive increase in recent years.

### Incubators

As indicated in the study, many incubators and accelerators specialized in the agri-food value chain have emerged, supporting early-stage startups. Such is the case of Porcinnova, one of the 11 High Technology Incubators (IAT), promoted by the INCYDE Foundation (Instituto Cameral para la Creaci√≥n y Desarrollo de la Empresa). The study mentions it as one of the main incubators in the sector.

Porcinnova is part of the IAT program for the promotion of innovation and technology transfer to micro-SMEs co-financed by the Regional Development Fund (ERDF) within Spain's Multi-regional Operational Program ERDF 2014-2020: A way of doing Europe. And, in this case, it is also co-financed in a complementary way by the Government of Aragon.
