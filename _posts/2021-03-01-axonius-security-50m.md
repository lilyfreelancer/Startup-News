With remote work being normalized, it's no wonder why cybersecurity is being elevated within many organizations. Axonius, a managed cybersecurity platform, is expanding into this trending field.

According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/axonius-nabs-100m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-asset-management-cybersecurity-platform/):

> Axonius, which lets organizations manage and track computing-based assets that are connecting to their networks — and then plug that data into some 300 different cybersecurity tools to analyse it — has closed a round of $100 million, a Series D that values the company at over $1 billion ($1.2 billion, to be exact).

> “We like to call ourselves the Toyota Camry of cybersecurity,” Axonius co-founder and CEO Dean Sysman told me in an interview last year. “It’s nothing exotic in a world of cutting-edge AI and advanced tech. However it’s a fundamental thing that people are struggling with, and it is what everyone needs. Just like the Camry.” It will be using the funding to continue scaling the company, it said, amid surging demand, with ARR growing to $10 million last year.

> This latest round — led by Stripes, with past investors Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP), OpenView, Lightspeed and Vertex also participating — represents a huge jump for the startup.
