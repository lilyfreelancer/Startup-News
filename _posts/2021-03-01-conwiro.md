[ConWiro](https://www.linkedin.com/company/conwiro) is an indie Cuban video game studio with the mission of making products defined by their creativity, playability, narrative and artistic quality. Without losing sight of the fact that, above all, the creations of this small gamer group must be fun, they work every day to position themselves as one of the best video game studios on the island, in a market that is vaguely dominated by Cuban companies. The dream they pursue? To one day be able to compete with the best independent studios in the world.

## Why ConWiro? 

The name to select is one of the simplest and most complex things at the same time, since in the same word you have to summarize and transmit the essence of what you do.

The team wanted it to be catchy, hard to forget and with something Cuban, as opposed to the typical Americanized brands.

After making a list of the ones they liked the most, it was decided on the one that would best reflect their work and that is how ConWiro came about. Wiro, which in Cuban slang means head, brain, that's why we decided to make things ConWiro.
