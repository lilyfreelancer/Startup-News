This month's **Ipsos Global Consumer Confidence Index** stands at 43.9, up 0.4 points from last month. Although at its highest point since April 2020, the index is still almost five points lower than 12 months ago, when the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency.

The pace of global recovery remains very slow. This month's increase is on par with the average month-on-month increase of 0.4 points seen since August.

The Global Consumer Confidence Index is the average of the National Indices of 24 world markets. It is based on a monthly survey of more than 17,500 adults under the age of 75 via Ipsos' Global Advisor online platform. This survey was conducted between January 22 and February 5, 2021.

## National Index trends

One sign that consumer sentiment is barely moving in much of the world is that only two countries register a significant change (i.e., an increase or decrease of at least 1.5 points) in their National Index compared to January:

A loss of 2.3 points to 71.8 in China, its lowest level since September 2020.

A gain of 2.5 points to 56.1 in India, its highest level since April 2020.

Compared to 12 months ago, only two countries register an increase in their National Index: China (+6.5) and Australia (+3.5). In contrast, 20 of the 24 countries have a National Index significantly lower than in February 2020, especially the United States (-12.6), Israel (-11.4), Mexico (-10.3), Poland (-10.2) and Spain (-9.9). Seven countries (the same as in January and December 2020) have a National Index above 50:
- China (71.8)
- Saudi Arabia (63.5)
- India (56.1)
- Sweden (55.1)
- Australia (54.1)
- Germany (51.1)
- USA (50.3) (50.3)

Only three countries still have a national index below 35 this month, as Russia (36.3) has dropped out:

- Turkey (32.0),
- South Africa (33.8)
- Spain (34.2)
