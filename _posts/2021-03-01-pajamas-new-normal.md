With work-from-home being the new normal in tech companies, the average bloke can get away with working in their pajamas. In fact, there is a huge demand  to buy trendy pajamas that would even be fashionable in a Zoom conference call.

The issue is that there are so many options to choose from, including luxury brands with exorbitant price tags. Buying a new pair of pajamas doesn’t necessarily need to be a big investment considering you probably won’t be seen outside much. You should buy with comfort, practicality, and longevity in mind. 

Let's take a look at some pajamas that would make your stay-at-home orders much easier...

## Men's Work at Home Pajamas

When looking for practical [pajamas for men](https://searchshops.com/collection/men-pajamas), you might like to go with something loose with a smooth material that can withstand sitting or laying down for extended periods. With that in mind, I think you can't go wrong with a pair of Macy's **comfort stretch pajama pants**.

I know that since I've converted to working at home, having comfortable and flexible pants is highly valuable. I find this pair to be well insulated during the Winter, yet not too constricted to be usable during this up coming spring/summer.

If you're not a fan of sleeping or sitting in long slacks, the **Jersey pajama shorts** by J. Crew may be more in the spirit of warm climates. In fact, they’re fancy enough to go outside once things go back to normal.

While some may not like the style, I am fond of the surfer look since I won’t be able to take a vacation to the beach for quite awhile. These shorts are loose enough to make summer bearable.

## Women's Work at Home Pajamas

There are distinct aesthetic differences found in [pajamas for women](https://searchshops.com/collection/women-pajamas), but the goal is ultimately the same. Having something comfortable and practical for the season is essential to make your new home-centered life more bearable.

Macy's printed ultra-soft pajamas is comfortable, and in my opinion, has an iconic style of how pajamas should look like. And considering the retail price tag, it doesn’t look like a budget set of pajamas in the least.

There are multiple printed styles available direct from Macy’s, so mix and match your own style.

If you're looking for a looser fit and flamboyant look, definitely opt for the high-waisted Sunday sleep ultra-soft plus-size Pajama Joggers by Old Navy.
