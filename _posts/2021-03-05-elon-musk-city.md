Billionaire Elon Musk continues to make waves with one of his latest ideas: to create his own technology city.

This is what the founder of Tesla and SpaceX has indicated on his official Twitter account, even including the name that the new facilities will bear: **Starbase.**

The aim of this city would be to be the center of expeditions to Mars, one of Musk's main dreams. 

The location of the site would be in the state of Texas, near the town of Boca Chica, close to the place where SpaceX launches are being carried out. In fact, it seems that Musk has already requested the incorporation of Boca Chica to the new city, although Judge Eddie Trevi√±o, of Cameron County, where this Starbase would be located, has indicated in a statement that he is open to the implementation of such a project, but provided that state statutes are met.

For the moment, this is just one more of Elon Musk's ideas, which have always given rise to talk, but the tycoon has already begun to give details about how this new city would be. In fact, he has indicated that it will be suitable for pets or that it will have a strong technological component, with cryptocurrencies as the main exponent. 

Thus, this new city would be equipped with the most cutting-edge services and infrastructure from the point of view of technology, turning into reality what has often been seen in science fiction movies.

Tesla has become one of Elon Musk's favorite places for his companies, since SpaceX and Tesla's major projects will also be launched there.
