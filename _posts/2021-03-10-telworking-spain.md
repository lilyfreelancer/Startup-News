Teleworking has gone from being used by 5% of the working population to 25% in just one year, coinciding with the coronavirus pandemic, and driven largely by the confinement that for months affected the whole country, according to the report [Familiados sobre conciliación familiar en España 2021](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mzJML02oYI4ujfdcIOpfqkDkLimxJiNr/view?usp=sharing) (Familiados report on family reconciliation in Spain 2021).

Before the pandemic, only 5% of Spanish workers teleworked, but with the arrival of COVID-19, more than 50% of companies implemented different teleworking options. In other words, from less than 5% to 25% of the workforce teleworking.

According to Nortempo, more than 20% of companies will continue teleworking once the pandemic is over. A trend that is here to stay, and that will substantially modify the plans of companies and the relations between companies and workers in the coming years. A change that would have taken 10 years to complete, had it not been for the coronavirus.

The report also highlights the role played by women during the pandemic. Thus, healthcare workers, together with nursing home staff, have been at the forefront of the battle against COVID-19. In this context, it should be noted that at least 66% of professionals are women. Even more so in the socio-health sector, where 84% are women.

These percentages are even higher in the pharmaceutical sector, in direct sales in stores and in cleaning staff. "It is an indisputable fact that the front line has had a much more feminine face than masculine", says the report on conciliation of Familiados.

At home, women also played a greater role than men. According to this report, 1 in 5 mothers gave up part or all of their work during the quarantine period, and of those who continued to work, 80% had difficulty in teleworking. The report clearly states: "Women spent on average 30% more time than men caring for children and dependents during the pandemic".
